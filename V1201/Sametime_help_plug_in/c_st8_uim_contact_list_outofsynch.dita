<title>What does the contact list conflict message mean?</title>
<shortdesc>Your contact list is stored both on your community server
and on your workstation. If you use Sametime on more than one computer,
you might see a contact list conflict message. The message displays
when your contact list on one of these computers gets out-of-synch
with the version on the server.</shortdesc>
<conbody>
<p><note type="tip"> To update a contactsâ€™ nickname automatically
so it does not get out-of-sync, edit a contact's nickname by right-clicking
a contact.</note></p>
<p>When you see a contact list conflict message, you can select from
the following options:</p>
<p>Before you select an option, think about the implications of your
choice.</p>

simple table that explains the options and information to help you

be in the UI eventually.</draft-comment></p></desc>

<entry colname="col2">Choose this option if a version on another computer
is more current. <p>For example, you clean up a long and unorganized
contact list on one computer, and your changes are saved to the server.
If you start another computer and see the conflict message, choose
this option, so your changes are not lost.</p></entry>
