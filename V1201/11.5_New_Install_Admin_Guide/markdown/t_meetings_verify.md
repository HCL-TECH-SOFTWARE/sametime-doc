# Verifying the service {#t_meetings_verify .task}

This section provides information to verify if you are able to join a meeting, see and hear the other participants.

Verify that at least three parties can join a meeting, see, and hear each other. Two-person meetings are optimized to avoid a media path through the server and so don't provide a valid test.

**To verify the service from one machine:**

1.  Log in to the meeting from one machine as three seperate users, each in their own browser tab.

2.  Unmute any user.

3.  If you can hear the user, the service is functioning.
