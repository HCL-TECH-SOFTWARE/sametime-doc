# Accessibility features for Sametime {#over_accessibility .concept}

Accessibility features help users who have a disability, such as restricted mobility or limited vision, to use information technology products successfully. HCL® strives to provide products with usable access for everyone.

## Accessibility features { .section}

HCL Sametime® uses the latest W3C Standard, [WAI-ARIA 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/) to ensure compliance to [US Section 508](http://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-section-508-standards/section-508-standards) and [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\) 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).

**Note:** For the best accessible experience, use the latest versions of both the screen reader and browser.

-   The following features are for vision-impaired users:
    -   Can be operated by using only the keyboard
    -   Communicates all information independent of color
    -   Supports interfaces commonly used by screen readers and screen magnifiers
    -   Supports the attachment of alternate output devices

        **Attention:** If you modify the level of contrast, you must restart the HCL Sametime client for the change to take effect.

        When a Sametime web browser user chooses to share the screen, the user is prompted with three options: to share the entire screen, part of the screen, or a particular application. For this prompt to be accessible to a screen reader, the user must install the Java™ access bridge. For installation instructions, see the [Oracle web site](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-136191.html).
