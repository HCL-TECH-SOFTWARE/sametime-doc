# Sametime Client IDs {#new_client_ids .task}

Sametime clients declare their client type when connecting to the Sametime server. There are several features that use the client types. If planning on implementing these features, the Sametime client types should be included. For more information on client types, see [Table of Client types that are connecting to a Sametime server](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0024444).
