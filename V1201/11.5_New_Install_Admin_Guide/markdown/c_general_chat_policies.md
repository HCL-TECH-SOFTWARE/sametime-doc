# **General chat policies** {#c_general_chat_policies .concept}

These policies control chat behavior. Edit the following policies to fit your business needs.

## Policy id = im.enableOfflineMessages, Default Setting: ON {#section_sx5_cbg_htb .section}

By default, you can send messages to offline users. Turn this setting off to disable offline messages.

**Note:** Regardless of the setting, you need to be active on your mobile device to receive message notifications.

## Policy id = im.persistentChatEnabled, Default Setting: ON {#section_r4c_fbg_htb .section}

By default, chat history is stored in the server. Leave this setting on if you want the full chat transcript to be available to all clients using the same ID. When turned off, the chat history is maintained only at the clients and is deleted immediately when the user is logged out.

**Note:** Regardless of the setting, chat history is no longer stored *locally* on mobile devices.
