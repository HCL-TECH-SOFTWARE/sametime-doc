# **General meeting policies** {#c_general_meetings_policies .concept}

These policies determine how third-party meetings and Sametime meetings are handled on Sametime mobile. Edit the following policies to fit your business needs.

## Policy id = im.thirdPartyMeetingEnabled, Default Setting: ON {#section_sd4_t1g_htb .section}

By default, you can add third-party meeting URLs to your favorites list. When turned off, users can only add Sametime meetings to the list.

## Policy id = im.meetingsEnabled Default Setting: ON {#section_uxf_xbg_htb .section}

By default, all users can create and start meetings. When turned on, the **My Meetings** list is displayed on the Meetings dialog. Turn this setting off to allow users to join Sametime meetings but restrict them from creating and starting their own.
