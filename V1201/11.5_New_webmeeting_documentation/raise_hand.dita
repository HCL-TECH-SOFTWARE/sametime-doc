  <title>Raising hands</title>
  <shortdesc>By default, all meeting participants have access to the <uicontrol>Raise
      hand</uicontrol> feature. Toggling the hand is visible to all meeting participants. As a guest
    or authenticated user, you can raise and lower hands throughout the meeting to request to speak,
    answer a poll, or as a form of silent acknowledgment. Moderators can lower a userâ€™s hand. <image
