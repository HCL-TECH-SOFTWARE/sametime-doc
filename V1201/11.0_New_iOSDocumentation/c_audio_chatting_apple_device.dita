<p>The Audio Chat tab on the left menu displays two panes of information. </p>
<p>The first pane is a list of recent audio chats, with the most recent listed at the top. The list
                    indicates with icons whether you initiated an audio chat, received a
                    notification, declined a notification, or if you missed calls. Tapping on any of
                    the items displays the person card of the chat partner.</p>
                <p>The second pane contains the dialing keypad. You can use the keypad to directly
                    dial a number by using Connections Chat or a third-party dialer.</p>
