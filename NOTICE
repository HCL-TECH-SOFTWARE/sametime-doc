Licence

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE 
("CCPL" OR "LICENCE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF 
THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. BY 
EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF 
THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR 
ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

This Creative Commons England and Wales Public Licence enables You (all capitalised terms defined 
below) to view, edit, modify, translate and distribute Works worldwide, provided that You credit 
the Original Author.

'The Licensor' [one or more legally recognised persons or entities offering the Work under the 
terms and conditions of this Licence]

and

'You'

agree as follows:

1. Definitions

    "Attribution" means acknowledging all the parties who have contributed to and have rights in 
    the Work, Derivative Work or Collective Work under this Licence.
    "Collective Work" means the Work in its entirety in unmodified form along with a number of 
    other separate and independent works, assembled into a collective whole.
    "Derivative Work" means any work created by the editing, modification, adaptation or 
    translation of the Work in any media (however a work that constitutes a Collective Work will 
    not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence). For the avoidance of 
    doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of 
    the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative 
    Work for the purpose of this Licence.
    "Licence" means this Creative Commons England and Wales Public Licence agreement.
    "Original Author" means the individual (or entity) who created the Work.
    "Work" means the work protected by copyright which is offered under the terms of this Licence.
    For the purpose of this Licence, when not inconsistent with the context, words in the singular 
    number include the plural number.

2. Licence Terms

2.1 The Licensor hereby grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, Licence for use 
and for the duration of copyright in the Work.

You may:

    copy the Work;
    create one or more Derivative Works;
    incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works;
    copy Derivative Works or the Work as incorporated in any Collective Work; and
    publish, distribute, archive, perform or otherwise disseminate the Work, Derivative Works 
    or the Work as incorporated in any Collective Work, to the public in any material form in any 
    media whether now known or hereafter created.

HOWEVER,

You must not:

    impose any terms on the use to be made of the Work, the Derivative Work or the Work as 
    incorporated in a Collective Work that alter or restrict the terms of this Licence or any 
    rights granted under it or has the effect or intent of restricting the ability to exercise 
    those rights;
    impose any digital rights management technology on the Work, the Derivative Work or the Work 
    as incorporated in a Collective Work that alters or restricts the terms of this Licence or 
    any rights granted under it or has the effect or intent of restricting the ability to 
    exercise those rights;
    sublicense the Work;
    subject the Work to any derogatory treatment as defined in the Copyright, Designs and Patents 
    Act 1988.

FINALLY,

You must:

    make reference to this Licence (by Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), spoken word or as 
    appropriate to the media used) on all copies of the Work and Derivative Works and Collective 
    Works published, distributed, performed or otherwise disseminated or made available to the 
    public by You;
    recognise the Licensor's / Original Author's right of attribution in any Work, Derivative Work 
    and Collective Work that You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate to the 
    public and ensure that You credit the Licensor / Original Author as appropriate to the media 
    used; and
    to the extent reasonably practicable, keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence, in 
    particular the URI, if any, that the Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, 
    unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.

Additional Provisions for third parties making use of the Work

2.2. Further licence from the Licensor

Each time You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate

    the Work; or
    any Derivative Work; or
    the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work

the Licensor agrees to offer to the relevant third party making use of the Work (in any of the 
alternatives set out above) a licence to use the Work on the same terms and conditions as granted 
to You hereunder.

2.3. This Licence does not affect any rights that the User may have under any applicable law, 
including fair use, fair dealing or any other legally recognised limitation or exception to 
copyright infringement.

2.4. All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not 
limited to, the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a licensing body, such as 
a collecting society, royalties for any use of the Work.

3. Warranties and Disclaimer

Except as required by law, the Work or any Derivative Work is licensed by the Licensor on an 
"as is" and "as available" basis and without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied.

4. Limit of Liability

Subject to any liability which may not be excluded or limited by law the Licensor shall not be 
liable and hereby expressly excludes all liability for loss or damage howsoever and whenever 
caused to You.

5. Termination

The rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate automatically upon any breach by 
You of the terms of this Licence. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or 
Collective Works from You under this Licence, however, will not have their Licences terminated 
provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those Licences.

6. General

6.1. The validity or enforceability of the remaining terms of this agreement is not affected by 
the holding of any provision of it to be invalid or unenforceable.

6.2. This Licence constitutes the entire Licence Agreement between the parties with respect to 
the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect 
to the Work not specified here. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that 
may appear in any communication in any form.

6.3. A person who is not a party to this Licence shall have no rights under the Contracts 
(Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any of its terms.

6.4. This Licence shall be governed by the law of England and Wales and the parties irrevocably 
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of England and Wales.

7. On the role of Creative Commons

7.1. Neither the Licensor nor the User may use the Creative Commons logo except to indicate that 
the Work is licensed under a Creative Commons Licence. Any permitted use has to be in compliance 
with the Creative Commons trade mark usage guidelines at the time of use of the Creative Commons 
trade mark. These guidelines may be found on the Creative Commons website or be otherwise 
available upon request from time to time.

7.2. Creative Commons Corporation does not profit financially from its role in providing this 
Licence and will not investigate the claims of any Licensor or user of the Licence.

7.3. One of the conditions that Creative Commons Corporation requires of the Licensor and You 
is an acknowledgement of its limited role and agreement by all who use the Licence that the 
Corporation is not responsible to anyone for the statements and actions of You or the Licensor 
or anyone else attempting to use or using this Licence.

7.4. Creative Commons Corporation is not a party to this Licence, and makes no warranty 
whatsoever in connection to the Work or in connection to the Licence, and in all events is not 
liable for any loss or damage resulting from the Licensor's or Your reliance on this Licence 
or on its enforceability.

7.5. USE OF THIS LICENCE MEANS THAT YOU AND THE LICENSOR EACH ACCEPTS THESE CONDITIONS IN 
SECTION 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 AND EACH ACKNOWLEDGES CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION'S VERY LIMITED ROLE 
AS A FACILITATOR OF THE LICENCE FROM THE LICENSOR TO YOU.
