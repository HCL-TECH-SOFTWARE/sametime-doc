hovers over a name in a chat window or a contact list. Business card information also displays at the top of an active chat window. Business cards are configured to access user information from the LDAP directory. To access the user information from the LDAP directory, Sametime provides a search engine called a black box. By default, you can choose the following fields to display in the business card. Photo Name Company E-mail address Telephone Address or location Title To troubleshoot problems with business cards, see Resolving problems with business cards . Business card photos must meet the following requirements: Photos must be less than 45K in size. Photos 10K or less are recommended. Photo file types .jpg and .gif are supported. Photos to be used in business card for mobile or web clients they must be in the format of a URL, such as hosted from a web server or HCL Connections Profiles server. Planning for business cards A single LDAP server must be used as the primary repository to retrieve user information. A secondary repository is optional and must be configured as a secondary LDAP server for business cards. Planning for photos If photos are used in a business card , they can be stored in the LDAP directory or in the format of a URL hosted from a web server. For mobile and web clients using the Sametime Proxy server, they must be stored in the format of a URL. Importing photos into a directory using an image/jpeg type is only supported on the Connect and Embedded clients. Importing photos into a directory increases the size of the directory. The increase in size can affect the performance of other applications that use the directory. Depending on the Sametime client type, the attribute to defined the photo location is different. PhotoURL supports the Web and Mobile clients. ImagePath supports the Connect and Notes Embedded clients. Photos set to image/jpeg type supports the Connect and Notes Embedded clients. PhotoURL and ImagePath can be mapped to the same LDAP field. To support all Sametime client types using a URL: The URL must be HTTP not HTTPS. Update the Sametime server UserInfoConfig.xml file to define both PhotoURL and ImagePath . For example: <Detail Type=\"text/plain\" FieldName=\"PhotoURL\" Id=\"ImagePath\"/> <Detail Type=\"text/plain\" FieldName=\"PhotoURL\" Id=\"PhotoURL\"/> <Set params=\"MailAddress,Name,Title,Location,Telephone,PhotoURL,ImagePath,Company\" SetId=\"0\"/> <Set params=\"MailAddress,Name,Title,Location,Telephone,PhotoURL,ImagePath,Company\" SetId=\"1\"/> After you have identified where the user information is stored, proceed to the applicable topic to configure business cards. Configuring business cards using an LDAP directory Configuring business cards is done in the UserInfoConfig.xml file in the community pod. Customizing business cards in Kubernetes You can override the default business cards configuration by creating an extra-community-configs secret to hold the configuration files. Customizing business cards in Docker and Podman You can override the default business cards configuration by editing a UserInfoConfig.xml file and adding it as a volume in the docker-compose.yml. Storing photos in the Domino directory If the Sametime server is connected to a Domino LDAP server, you can store business cards photos in the Domino Directory. Using HCL Connections photos for the Sametime business card You can use the HCL Connections profiles photos for the Sametime business cards. A benefits for using this method is that updated photos in Connections are automatically updated in Sametime. Retrieving photos from HTTPS hosts in Kubernetes Signer certificates establish the relationship in SSL communication. This step is needed by the Sametime server, specifically for cases where the PhotoURL is using SSL (HTTPS) to access business card photos.

The managed-community-configs.xml file is policy-based, so you can control communities for different user groups. You can also use the managed-community-configs.xml file to manage secondary communities, while preventing users from adding or deleting communities. Set the Allow Multiple Communities policy to false and use the managed-community-configs.xml to define the desired secondary communities. The client allows the user to log into secondary communities defined in the .xml file, but the user cannot delete secondary communities defined in the file. At login time, the client receives policies and checks for the existence of a managed-community-configs.xml file according to the Sametime update site URL policy. For example, if the administration update site URL is http://example.com/updates, the client looks for the file in http://example.com/updates/managed-community-configs.xml. Follow these steps to create and post a managed-community-configs.xml file. Create a settings XML file and save it as managed-community-configs.xml. Add settings for communities and actions in the file. Place the file on a web server, and post the URL (starting with http://) for the file to the Sametime update site URL in the Chat section of the Instant Messaging policy. If you changed the settings file to update the host name of a community to a new server that is part of the same community, users' contact lists are still valid with the new host.

Sametime Admin overview The Sametime Admin is a web access interface used to work with policies and analytic data related to Sametime Meetings and chat features. Managing policies Sametime policies allow administrators to control user access to features. Monitoring your meeting and chat metrics with Grafana Sametime uses the third-party software, Grafana, to generate insightful graphs and visualizations derived from time-series database (TSDB) data. Integrating Grafana into your Sametime environment allows you to see analytic metrics about Sametime meetings and chats on a Grafana dashboard. The metrics can be used to monitor Sametime usage and resources. Managing Sametime clients This section provides information on managing Sametime clients. Managing file transfer data As with meeting recordings and reports, files that are shared in the chat are stored in a Docker volume or a Kubernetes persistent volume. By default, you can download these files within 90 days . Testing Sametime chat and meeting clients This article assumes that you have successfully installed and configured Sametime or Sametime Premium. Starting and stopping the Sametime server Starting and stopping the Sametime server involves starting and stopping the Sametime services running in the container management system. Starting and stopping MongoDB Configuration files Configuration files maintain information used by the Sametime server for various reasons. Enabling multi-tenancy Multi-tenancy allows multiple organizations to be part of the Sametime community. With multi-tenancy, Sametime users can chat, add users and groups to contact lists, and have awareness of users in their organization or in other organizations that are configured to be visible to them. Using the Sametime Database utility The Sametime Database utility is used to synchronize the information with that of the Sametime server database. MongoDB This section provides information relating to administering MongoDB. Defining chat message deletion limits The chat deletion settings define how long a user has the ability to delete a message and undo the deletion. The default deletion time is twenty-four hours and one hour to undo the deletion. Managing Sametime Meetings This topic explains the features you can enable or disable for meetings.

Sametime Admin overview The Sametime Admin is a web access interface used to work with policies and analytic data related to Sametime Meetings and chat features. Managing policies Sametime policies allow administrators to control user access to features. Monitoring your meeting and chat metrics with Grafana Sametime uses the third-party software, Grafana, to generate insightful graphs and visualizations derived from time-series database (TSDB) data. Integrating Grafana into your Sametime environment allows you to see analytic metrics about Sametime meetings and chats on a Grafana dashboard. The metrics can be used to monitor Sametime usage and resources. Managing Sametime clients This section provides information on managing Sametime clients. Managing file transfer data As with meeting recordings and reports, files that are shared in the chat are stored in a Docker volume or a Kubernetes persistent volume. By default, you can download these files within 90 days . Testing Sametime chat and meeting clients This article assumes that you have successfully installed and configured Sametime or Sametime Premium. Starting and stopping the Sametime server Starting and stopping the Sametime server involves starting and stopping the Sametime services running in the container management system. Starting and stopping MongoDB Configuration files Configuration files maintain information used by the Sametime server for various reasons. Enabling multi-tenancy Multi-tenancy allows multiple organizations to be part of the Sametime community. With multi-tenancy, Sametime users can chat, add users and groups to contact lists, and have awareness of users in their organization or in other organizations that are configured to be visible to them. Using the Sametime Database utility The Sametime Database utility is used to synchronize the information with that of the Sametime server database. MongoDB This section provides information relating to administering MongoDB. Defining chat message deletion limits The chat deletion settings define how long a user has the ability to delete a message and undo the deletion. The default deletion time is twenty-four hours and one hour to undo the deletion. Managing Sametime Meetings This topic explains the features you can enable or disable for meetings. Currently, the settings that you can change are global settings that apply to the entire server. User policies cannot control the settings.

Policies with a higher weight take precedence over those with a lower weight. You can change the weight of policies to control their order of precedence by moving them up and down within the policy list. The policy weights of the anonymous and default policies, which are the lowest (0) and next-lowest (1) weights, cannot be changed. For a user or group that is assigned two or more policies, the policy with the highest weight is used. For authenticated users, Sametime searches for an exact ID match, and then applies the highest weighted policy. If there is no match for the specific user ID in any policy, then Sametime applies the highest weighted group match. If no group matches are found, the default policy is applied. Policies are only applied from the primary Sametime community. Additional server communities' policies are not pushed down to the users' desktops. A user's primary Sametime community is the first community listed in their Sametime Server Communities Properties settings. Policies applied to nested groups You can configure how Sametime considers nested groups when it applies policies and how many levels deep that are searched for the highest weighted group. By default, four levels of nested groups are searched when it determines the highest weighted policy. The maximum search depth limit is 10 levels and the minimum is -1 level (no nesting). If a policy is assigned to a group nested more than the current nesting depth, then the default policy is applied. If a group inherits a higher-level policy and is also assigned a policy directly, the directly assigned policy takes precedence over the inherited policy, regardless of either policy's weight. Note: Entering a large number as the maximum nested group depth can have an impact on performance. Examples In the following examples, the Renovations company has assigned employees to the following user groups. Notice that many of the groups have other groups nested within them.

The actual set of features available to each user depends on how these policies are weighted and nested. Nested groups inherit policies Policy A is assigned to Renovations Group. The nesting level is set to the default 4. George is assigned to Policy A because he belongs directly to the Renovations Group. Fernando is assigned to Policy A because his group falls within the group search nesting limit of 4 levels from the Renovations Group.

When you change user or group names in the directory, the change is not reflected in Sametime databases. In order to synchronize the directory names with the names in the Sametime databases, you must run the name conversion utility. You can run the name conversion utility manually on a stand-alone Community Server, or on a server in a cluster which replicates the change throughout the cluster. Note: You do not need to run the Sametime Database utility when adding new users or groups to the Domino or LDAP directory. The tool performs the following functions: Convert Delete Move Update\u200b \u200b Note: Refer to the Converting chat history owner data from Domino directory to LDAP format topic for the convert function. The utility is loaded to your Docker repository during the Sametime install process, it is located in the image repository. The name of the utility image is sametime-db-utility. The Sametime Database utility uses a comma-separated value (CVS) file that you compile to update, convert, or delete names which includes the descriptor that corresponds to the task to be completed. To use the utility, create a CVS that corresponds to the task to be completed. The CVS file must contain only one type of task, that is you cannot run an update and convert using the same CVS file. Note that CSV files are case-sensitive and sensitive to spaces. Descriptor Purpose DELETE Removes specified individual contact names from contact lists and privacy lists. ID Changes specified first names, last names, display names, or group names. TASK_LDAP Changes all contact list information from Domino Directory format to LDAP format. ORGANIZATION Change the organization name for all users. At the end of the Sametime Database utility run, a report file is generated containing a summary of changes applied to the database. You can view the report to verify your changes. The report contains a summary of changes applied to the database, including records touched, modified or deleted. It also has the count of records modified or deleted and which attribute is modified. The report file is created in the data folder. The report file name is in following format: name_change_summary_report_[date\\_time].log Converting chat history owner data from Domino directory to LDAP format The convert feature of the Sametime Database utility changes all contact list information from the Domino Directory format to LDAP format.

When you change user or group names in the directory, the change is not reflected in Sametime databases. In order to synchronize the directory names with the names in the Sametime databases, you must run the name conversion utility. You can run the name conversion utility manually on a stand-alone Community Server, or on a server in a cluster which replicates the change throughout the cluster. Note: You do not need to run the Sametime Database utility when adding new users or groups to the Domino or LDAP directory. The tool performs the following functions: Convert Delete Move Update\u200b \u200b Note: Refer to the Converting chat history owner data from Domino directory to LDAP format topic for the convert function. The utility is loaded to your Docker repository during the Sametime install process, it is located in the image repository. The name of the utility image is sametime-db-utility. The Sametime Database utility uses a comma-separated value (CVS) file that you compile to update, convert, or delete names which includes the descriptor that corresponds to the task to be completed. To use the utility, create a CVS that corresponds to the task to be completed. The CVS file must contain only one type of task, that is you cannot run an update and convert using the same CVS file. Note that CSV files are case-sensitive and sensitive to spaces. Descriptor Purpose DELETE Removes specified individual contact names from contact lists and privacy lists.

Sametime can also be installed into the same Kubernetes cluster as other products, for example, MongoDB as long as the system requirements are met. Note: The Sametime documentation does not provide full step-by-step instructions on creating a Kubernetes cluster because each Kubernetes provider has different steps. Consult your Kubernetes provider documentation for details on creating a cluster. Two types of server nodes with different requirements are required: role:main role:video The nodes are labeled with Kubernetes labels which allows the Kubernetes pod scheduler to assign the Kubernetes pods to the proper node type. The video node runs the video pods only. This allows the video pod full access to the machine. A video node is reached from clients by NodePort, directly to its Public IP address. There is no load balancer or service requirement for inbound media traffic, as the media traffic is addressed to the specific video bridge where the meeting is active. The machine type must be suitable for media, with a minimum of 4 CPU and 16GB of RAM. When creating the node, pool autoscaling must be enabled. The Sametime autoscaler uses CPU utilization to determine when to bring up more nodes. For guidance on how many nodes to include in the video node pool, contact HCL Availability zones for resiliency If you are installing Sametime into a cloud hosted Kubernetes environment, such as Google Kubernetes Engine, or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, consider creating nodes in more than one availability zone. This provides some additional resiliency if the cloud provider has an outage in a particular data center, having nodes in a different zone allow a fail over event to take place. Namespaces Many existing production environments use namespaces. A namespace can be used for Sametime, but it is not required. When you enable autoscaling, you are creating a namespace for monitoring and custom-metrics. If a namespace is created for Sametime, be sure to add the namespace argument to the helm and kubectl commands. For example, if you deploy Sametime in a namespace called sametime and you want to view a list of pod, issue the following command: kubectl -n sametime get pods To see a list of namespaces that are configured, issue the following command: kubectl get namespaces For additional information, see Namespace topic in the Kubernetes documentation. Network If you are new to Kubernetes, there are some concepts that are helpful to understand how to configure your firewall. There are small differences between cloud providers and on-prem providers where the names of the features may vary. The following information is generic to introduce the concept. It is important to understand the IP addresses used in a deployment have different ranges, and when configuring a firewall rule, the source IP and destination IP need to be considered. Node : A node is the virtual machine or hardware running the Kubernetes cluster, it hosts the pods that run the Sametime workloads. A node has an IP address in the node IP range, it will have both an internal IP address and an external IP address. Video nodes are reached by end users from their public IP address directly to the node\u2019s external IP address. Pod : A pod is a Kubernetes based workload, which has one or more containers inside. These are stateless in Sametime which means they have a defined life cycle and they do not persist. Each pod has its own unique cluster-wide IP address which changes as the pods are scaled. Typical container-to-container communications between pods on the same host are normally permitted without any additional configuration. For example, the community pod communicating to the proxy pod. : Pods have no awareness of the node host ports or IP addresses. Additionally, you cannot directly reach a pod IP address from outside of the cluster. To expose an application that is running in your pods to be reachable from outside your cluster, Kubernetes services and ingress are used. Ingress is used to expose web services, like Web Chat and Meetings. For on-premise Kubernetes clusters, ingress is also used to expose the Sametime mux to Connect clients and embedded clients which use port 1533. Service : A Kubernetes service is used by Sametime to expose various components running in pods outside the cluster. It provides a single endpoint to multiple back-ends. Kubernetes services have their own IP address range that is separate from the node IP and pod IP ranges. This provides a consistent IP address as a front-end since the IP addresses for pod change frequently. There are different types of services in Kubernetes, Sametime uses the LoadBalancer type service which directs traffic to back-end pods, each cloud provider has its own implementation of this and some cloud providers have more features than others. : For cloud hosted Kubernetes clusters, Sametime deploys the mux as a service with the LoadBalancer type for both an internal IP and an external IP. The external IP is used for Sametime Connect and Embedded clients to connect to Sametime. Use the external IP to configure your firewall rules to allow external traffic if you are supporting these clients. When you install an ingress controller in the cluster, it is also a LoadBalancer type service which has both a cluster IP and an external IP. To expose users to the web services in Sametime for Meetings and Web Chat, open port 443 to this external IP address. Some cloud providers enable this firewall rule automatically when the ingress controller is deployed into the cluster. Other Sametime components have services with cluster IP type service. To ensure that the websockets feature functions properly, ensure the video node IP can reach the Jitsi service cluster IP on ports 5280 and 5222 TCP/IP. This is because video uses a node IP address instead of one from the pod IP range. For details see the [Websockets fail to load after installing Sametime 11.6 or 12.0.x on Kubernetes](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0101583) knowledge article. All other Sametime components can communicate from inside the cluster to the service Cluster IP without additional firewall configuration. : When the connection from the community pod attempts to connect to an LDAP service outside the cluster, a source IP in the pod IP address range is used. Network Address Translation (NAT) : If you cannot permit your firewall to allow the entire pod IP address range, consider deploying a Network Address Translation (NAT). A source NAT can replace the source IP address on a packet. Note that each Kubernetes cloud provider has its own implementation and features for NAT. For an overview, see the Using Source IP topic in the Kubernetes documentation. : If you are deploying telephony, the Jitsi pod with Jigasi inside uses a source IP from the pod IP range when connecting to the ilink Teamcall Meeting Gateway (TMG) for SIP. You can enable a source NAT for the entire Kubernetes cluster which will cover both LDAP and Telephony traffic. Storage When you create a persistent volume there is a certain type of access mode associated with it. If you have more than one node in the main node pool, be sure to use read-write-many (RWX) access mode, this allows for more than one node to access the volume at a time. If you only have one main node in the node pool, the standard read-write-once access (RWO) is sufficient. When configuring your persistent volume (PV), consider the types of data that are stored there, and what kinds of features users may utilize that place data in storage. Examples are: Files : Users can upload files to chats in any of the clients including meetings. They are stored in the PV and are retained for 90 days (configurable). Backgrounds : Users can upload their own virtual backgrounds to be used when they enable their video. These images are stored in the PV. Recordings : Recordings are saved as MP4 files, and vary in size depending on duration. Reports : When meeting reports are enabled, PDFs are saved in the PV containing the report. Monitoring and logging The Grafana dashboards shipped with Sametime provides multiple types of statistics. You can also deploy Elasticsearch, Fluentd and Kibana (EFK stack) to aggregate the logs and make them indexable. This is helpful to produce your own statistics, if the Grafana dashboard does not have the statistics you need. It can also aid in troubleshooting because the logs can be written to a PV outside of the pods. If the logs are not configured to be written to a PV using the EFK stack, then the logs are part of the pods and are lost when the pods are scaled. If you deploy the EFK stack, it has its own persistent volume separate from the Sametime pods. While these tools are helpful, they do not provide proactive monitoring to alert the administrator of problems. Other products can be used for monitoring such as: Panopta or New Relic. Container registry The Sametime container images can be stored and retrieved from a public or private container registry. Using a registry might require authenticated access or keys. The Sametime server authenticates with the container registry using a Kubernetes secret. The secret must be created prior to installing Sametime. During the install process container images are pushed to the container registry by running the load.sh script. The container images are retrieved by the pods when the pod is initialized. For additional information, see the Using a private registry topic in the Kubernetes documentation. MongoDB MongoDB is deployed separately from Sametime and can be deployed as a standalone virtual machine (VM), a cluster installed on VMs, or a Kubernetes cluster. MongoDB has options for both running your own Kubernetes cluster or a cloud hosted cluster. These options might require an enterprise license. For more information or questions about licensing, contact a MongoDB representative. Contact information can be found on the MongoDB, Inc website. MongoDB can be also be installed into the same Kubernetes cluster as Sametime. Ensure that you allow for additional capacity if installing into the same node pool as the main node pool, or you can dedicate a node pool to MongoDB.

There are small differences between cloud providers and on-prem providers where the names of the features may vary. The following information is generic to introduce the concept. It is important to understand the IP addresses used in a deployment have different ranges, and when configuring a firewall rule, the source IP and destination IP need to be considered. Node : A node is the virtual machine or hardware running the Kubernetes cluster, it hosts the pods that run the Sametime workloads. A node has an IP address in the node IP range, it will have both an internal IP address and an external IP address. Video nodes are reached by end users from their public IP address directly to the node\u2019s external IP address. Pod : A pod is a Kubernetes based workload, which has one or more containers inside. These are stateless in Sametime which means they have a defined life cycle and they do not persist. Each pod has its own unique cluster-wide IP address which changes as the pods are scaled. Typical container-to-container communications between pods on the same host are normally permitted without any additional configuration. For example, the community pod communicating to the proxy pod. : Pods have no awareness of the node host ports or IP addresses. Additionally, you cannot directly reach a pod IP address from outside of the cluster. To expose an application that is running in your pods to be reachable from outside your cluster, Kubernetes services and ingress are used. Ingress is used to expose web services, like Web Chat and Meetings. For on-premise Kubernetes clusters, ingress is also used to expose the Sametime mux to Connect clients and embedded clients which use port 1533. Service : A Kubernetes service is used by Sametime to expose various components running in pods outside the cluster. It provides a single endpoint to multiple back-ends. Kubernetes services have their own IP address range that is separate from the node IP and pod IP ranges. This provides a consistent IP address as a front-end since the IP addresses for pod change frequently. There are different types of services in Kubernetes, Sametime uses the LoadBalancer type service which directs traffic to back-end pods, each cloud provider has its own implementation of this and some cloud providers have more features than others. : For cloud hosted Kubernetes clusters, Sametime deploys the mux as a service with the LoadBalancer type for both an internal IP and an external IP. The external IP is used for Sametime Connect and Embedded clients to connect to Sametime. Use the external IP to configure your firewall rules to allow external traffic if you are supporting these clients. When you install an ingress controller in the cluster, it is also a LoadBalancer type service which has both a cluster IP and an external IP. To expose users to the web services in Sametime for Meetings and Web Chat, open port 443 to this external IP address. Some cloud providers enable this firewall rule automatically when the ingress controller is deployed into the cluster. Other Sametime components have services with cluster IP type service. To ensure that the websockets feature functions properly, ensure the video node IP can reach the Jitsi service cluster IP on ports 5280 and 5222 TCP/IP. This is because video uses a node IP address instead of one from the pod IP range. For details see the [Websockets fail to load after installing Sametime 11.6 or 12.0.x on Kubernetes](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0101583) knowledge article. All other Sametime components can communicate from inside the cluster to the service Cluster IP without additional firewall configuration. : When the connection from the community pod attempts to connect to an LDAP service outside the cluster, a source IP in the pod IP address range is used. Network Address Translation (NAT) : If you cannot permit your firewall to allow the entire pod IP address range, consider deploying a Network Address Translation (NAT). A source NAT can replace the source IP address on a packet. Note that each Kubernetes cloud provider has its own implementation and features for NAT. For an overview, see the Using Source IP topic in the Kubernetes documentation. : If you are deploying telephony, the Jitsi pod with Jigasi inside uses a source IP from the pod IP range when connecting to the ilink Teamcall Meeting Gateway (TMG) for SIP. You can enable a source NAT for the entire Kubernetes cluster which will cover both LDAP and Telephony traffic.","title":"Network"},{"location":"admin/c_planning_kubernetes_cluster.html#section_qf1_nb5_swb","text":"When you create a persistent volume there is a certain type of access mode associated with it. If you have more than one node in the main node pool, be sure to use read-write-many (RWX) access mode, this allows for more than one node to access the volume at a time. If you only have one main node in the node pool, the standard read-write-once access (RWO) is sufficient. When configuring your persistent volume (PV), consider the types of data that are stored there, and what kinds of features users may utilize that place data in storage. Examples are: Files : Users can upload files to chats in any of the clients including meetings. They are stored in the PV and are retained for 90 days (configurable). Backgrounds : Users can upload their own virtual backgrounds to be used when they enable their video. These images are stored in the PV. Recordings : Recordings are saved as MP4 files, and vary in size depending on duration.

You can also deploy Elasticsearch, Fluentd and Kibana (EFK stack) to aggregate the logs and make them indexable. This is helpful to produce your own statistics, if the Grafana dashboard does not have the statistics you need. It can also aid in troubleshooting because the logs can be written to a PV outside of the pods. If the logs are not configured to be written to a PV using the EFK stack, then the logs are part of the pods and are lost when the pods are scaled. If you deploy the EFK stack, it has its own persistent volume separate from the Sametime pods.

A mobile user cannot connect to the Sametime server without a special mobile community definition that provides details needed for the connection. Creating the mobile community is often frustrating for users because they do not have ready access to required information such as the Sametime proxy server's hostname and port. A provisioning URL for the mobile community makes it easy for users to connect to Sametime from their mobile devices after installing the client. To connect to Sametime, the user simply taps the provisioning link or scans the associated QR code, and then: If the user is logged in to Sametime, an alert explains that the user must log out of Sametime to use the link, and then resumes the previous session so the user can log out and try again. If the user already belongs to a community with the same configurations (server, port, and user name) an alert prompts the user to confirm that the existing community definition should be updated. When the user confirms the update, the new settings are applied. If the user does not already belong to the community associated with the configuration, Sametime displays the Add Community panel with fields filled in with information from the URL. The user verifies and saves the information. You can format the URL as a link or as a QR code, and distribute it in email or post it on a website. The provisioned URL is supported on the following mobile operating systems: Google Android 6 or later. Apple iOS 13 or later. Note: Starting with HCL Sametime version 11, the browser client displays a QR code that can be used to configure the HCL Sametime client for Android or iOS. Once logged into the browser client, open Settings and then Configure Mobile Client. The QR code displayed represents a secure community configuration for the Sametime proxy server and port that the browser is connected to. The QR code also includes the users\u2019 ID and a default community name of Sametime. The user only needs to follow the instructions to scan the code and enter their password before connecting with a mobile device. If you wish to use a different community name or perhaps the mobile clients need to connect through an authenticating proxy, the administrator can create a custom provisioning URL using the information contained in this article and then configure the Sametime proxy to display the QR code for the custom provisioning URL rather than the default one mentioned above. Procedure to create the custom provisioning URL Create and distribute a custom provisioning URL by completing the following steps: Create the URL by defining its components: The URL is formatted as shown: hclsametime://st_user@stproxy_host:port/?action=AddCommunity&communityName=community_name where: hclsametime:// is a required prefix to ensure that the URL is recognized and processed correctly. st_user the user name, or login ID, of a particular Sametime user; for example, myid@mycompany.com If you are sending or posting a URL for use by multiple people, you will probably not want to code a specific user's ID into the URL because other users may find that confusing. Instead, you can supply a variable or a partial user name and instruct users to modify the URL with the completed user name on their own devices, or you can omit the user name entirely so that each user is prompted for credentials when logging in to Sametime. If you want users to be able to simply click a link or QR code to use the URL, you should omit the user name and allow the user to provide credentials at login. Note: In addition, you can optionally instruct users to include the associated password in the URL with the following syntax: st_user:st_password ; however, this is not a good practice because the password could potentially be consumed by an untrusted app. stproxy_host is the fully qualified host name of the Sametime Proxy Server; for example: stproxy.example.com . port is the port that the Sametime Proxy Server is listening on. If omitted, 443 will be used. ?action=AddCommunity is a required parameter that ensures the information within the URL is added to the mobile client as a community definition. &communityName=*community\\_name* is an optional URL-encoded string that provides a name for the new community. If you do not specify a name with this parameter, a default name will be created based on the Sametime Proxy Server's host name. The table below provides the complete list of parameters that you can include in the URL and indicates whether each parameter is required. Name Value Description action AddCommunity Required. This string identifies the URL as an auto-provisioning operation. communityName URL-encoded string Optional: A user-friendly nickname for the newly created community. If you do not specify a name with this parameter, a default name will be created based on the Sametime Proxy Server's host name. savePassword true or false Optional: Indicates whether passwords are remembered for this connection. Applies to both Sametime and authenticating proxy passwords. The default value is false. authProxyEnabled true or false Optional: Indicates whether the connection requires authentication with a reverse-proxy server. The default value is false. If this parameter is omitted but authenticating proxy credentials are supplied, Sametime behaves if this parameter is set to true. authProxyReuseCredentials true Optional, but if you include this parameter, you must set it to true. Indicates whether reverse-proxy authentication will use the Sametime user ID and password provided earlier in the URL authProxyUser URL-encoded user ID value Optional: User ID value to use for reverse proxy authentication. If present, proxy authentication is assumed to be enabled. Users can input proxy passwords separately before login. allowUntrustedSSL true or false Optional: Determines whether untrusted SSL is allowed for this connection. The default and recommended values are false . When this option is enabled, Sametime allows connections over untrusted channels and you risk exposure of your data to attackers attempting to steal your information. Examples: Encrypted (SSL) direct connection to server stproxyserver.example.com on default port 443 with no user-specified but the community name is specified as \"Sametime Server\" : hclsametime://stproxyserver.example.com/?action=AddCommunity&communityName=Sametime%20Server To preserve correct URL syntax, the space in \"Sametime Server\" is represented with %20 .

Configure the Sametime server to display the QR code for your custom provisioning URL using the browser clients Configure Mobile Client feature. Configuring the Sametime server to use the custom provisioning URL Before updating the stproxyconfig.xml, examine the URL. URL encode any ampersands or spaces.

Parent Topic: Sametime client configuration options","title":"Creating a community provisioning URL for mobile users"},{"location":"admin/config_buscard.html","text":"Configuring business cards using an LDAP directory Configuring business cards is done in the UserInfoConfig.xml file in the community pod. Before you start setting up your business cards, ensure the following: The LDAP server is running and accessible by the Sametime server. All LDAP attributes needed by the business card are accessible for query through an anonymous connection or by using a specific bind account and password. If using an Domino LDAP, edit the server configuration settings to allow anonymous users to access required user details. In the Domino Administrator or Notes Client, click Configuration > All Server Documents > Configurations to access the All Servers document. Click Edit Configurations . Under the LDAP tab, you can view and add LDAP attributes that can be retrieved by anonymous users to the Anonymous users can query list. Configuration settings for business cards are in the UserInfoConfig.xml file in the community container or pod. For most environments, the UserInfoConfig.xml file works with default settings. You can override the default configuration settings by modifying the UserInfoConfig.xml file. The procedure to update the UserInfoConfig.xml file is different on Kubernetes and Docker. When modifying the XML file be sure to check the formatting using a browser. If there is an error with the formatting of the XML file, a business failure can occur. When using multiple LDAP servers, each LDAP server requires its own settings. By default, only the first server is configured during setup. To add additional LDAP servers, use the existing settings as a template. Locate the <StorageType=\u201dLDAP\u201d> section and copy everything between the <StorageType=\u201dLDAP\u201d> and </Storage> statements. Paste the statements at the end of the section below the </Storage> statement. This creates a new LDAP section. See Configuring additional LDAP servers on Kubernetes for information on configuring LDAP. Configure an authenticated bind. In some environments, not all the attributes are available to an anonymous bind, and an authenticated bind must be used. During the Sametime installation, anonymous binds to LDAP is configured by default. When a custom UserInfoConfig.xml file is being used, the LDAP bind credentials are being overridden. Bind credentials are located in the .env file for Docker and the sametime-global-secret in Kubernetes. Use the echo command to find the base64 encoded value for the user name and password. Specify the user name and password separated by a colon. For example, if the Bind user name is CN=stbind,O=example and the password is securePassword , enter the following command in a Linux shell: echo -n \u2018CN=stbind,O=example:securePassword\u2019 | base64 The results from the command is the value of a new argument called UserEncodedAuth. Replace the user name and password parameters with UserEncodedAuth=\"value\" . For example: <StorageDetails HostName=\"ldap2.example.com\" Port=\"1389\" UserEncodedAuth=\u201d 4oCYQ049c3RiaW5kLE89ZXhhbXBsZTpzZWN1cmVQYXNzd29yZOKAmQ==\u201d SslEnabled=\"true\" SslPort=\"636\" BaseDN=\"\" Scope=\"2\" SearchFilter=\"(&amp;(objectclass=organizationalPerson)(|(cn=%s)(givenname=%s)(sn=%s)(displayName=%s)(mail=%s)))\"/> By default, the LDAP operations are not encoded, and all communications are sent over clear text. To enable encryption, first follow the instructions in Securing connections between Sametime servers and LDAP . After the keystore has been created, update the SSL properties to include the path to the keystore and its password. For example: <SslProperties KeyStorePath=\"keys.p12\" KeyStorePassword=\"securePassword\"/> Verify the port number on the SslPort property. The default LDAP port number is 636. SslPort=\"port\\_number\" Change the setting for SslEnabled to true. SslEnabled=\"true\" Review the default search filter and make changes to fit your LDAP server\u2019s schema. The BaseDN field specifies where to start searching in the directory. For example, if all users are located in cn=users,dc=example,dc=com , you could set your BaseDN=\u201dcn=users,dc=example,dc=com\u201c so that the rest of the directory is not searched. A BaseDN is required if using Microsoft Active Directory and is not required for Domino LDAP. Scope specifies how deep the search is done, enter one of the following. 0 = Base : A lookup operation. Only a single entry described by the base DN is matched. 1 = One level : Searching is performed one level below the base DN and no further. This is like opening a folder in a file system and looking only at the direct elements inside the folder. 2 = Subtree : All child entries of the base DN are searched, whether direct or not, including the base DN itself. The host name of the LDAP server is set during setup. Review the HostName setting and confirm that it is the fully qualified host name of the LDAP service, which might be a load balancer in front of a cluster of LDAP servers. If the host name is not correct, update it in the helm/values.yaml file for Kubernetes or the .env file for Docker. Map the business card fields to LDAP attributes For each type of data, there is an Id and FieldName . The Id is the internal name used to identify each area of the business card. The FieldName value is set to the LDAP attribute that contains the data to display inside the business card. Modify any values that do not match your LDAP schema. These settings are in the <Details> section. Description Id name (do not change) Example The name of the attribute that holds the email address MailAddress mail The name of the attribute that has the user\u2019s Common Name. Name cn The name of the attribute that contains the user\u2019s title. Title title The name of the attribute that contains the user\u2019s physical address. Location postalAddress The name of the attribute that contains the user\u2019s phone number. Telephone telephoneNumber The name of the attribute that has the Company, organization or department name. Company ou The attribute containing the photo.** Photo jpegPhoto Note: ** If images are stored in a URL, see the step 8. If you would like to map additional detail to these fields it is possible with additional configuration modify the appropriate line in the <Details> section. For example, if there is both a desk phone number and a mobile phone number that you wish to include in the business card, you can use a separator between the two phone numbers when the information is displayed. Locate the <Detail> line with the telephone attributes. For desk phone number the attribute is telephoneNumber, and for mobile phone it is mobile. In the field name, include both attributes separated by a comma. FieldName=\u201dtelephoneNumber,mobile\u201d Add DisplaySeparator=\"separator\" to the statement identifying the separator. In the example, the forward slash is used as the separator. You can choose other characters as a separator. <Detail Type=\"text/plain\" Id=\"Telephone\" FieldName=\"telephoneNumber,mobile\" DisplaySeparator=\u201d / \u201c/> If photos are stored in a URL on a web server, the LDAP server must have an attribute that contains the URL. The attribute can be an existing attribute that has been repurposed or a new attribute can be created. Note: If you are using HCL Connections Profiles for the photos, see the topic Configuring Business Cards on HCL Connections . When using Connection Profile URLs, the photo name must be the email extension of .jpg. For example, if a user\u2019s email address is jane@example.com, the file name must be jane@example.com.jpg. Locate the <Details> section. Create a new <Details> line for the ImagePath to be used by desktop clients. In the FieldName setting, enter the attribute that contains the URL. For example,if the attribute that contains the photo URL is description the new line is: <Detail Type=\"text/plain\" Id=\"ImagePath\" FieldName=\"description\"/> If you have mobile clients, add an additional <DetailType> for PhotoURL. For example: <Detail Type=\"text/plain\" Id=\"PhotoURL\" FieldName=\"description\"/> In the Set params settings, select the Id names for the fields that you want to display as part of the business card. And remove any Ids that you do not want to include. For example, if you do not want to include the company name, remove \u201cCompany\u201d from the list of attributes. If you have added ImagePath, PhotoURL, or both, add these to the <Set params> and remove Photo. There are two lines that begin with <Set params> , each one has a unique SetID=. The one listed for SetId=\u201d0\u201d is for anonymous users. The one for SetId=\u201d1\u201d is for authenticated users. In the LDAP configuration, if the \"\ufeffThe attribute of the person entry that defines the internal ID of a Sametime user\" setting is not blank or set to anything other than the DN, the UserInfoConfig.xml file must be updated. Locate the StorageDetails tag of the relevant LDAP directory and add the following flags: UserIdAttribute= attribute_name Where attribute_name is the name of the attribute configured as the internal ID. PersonObjectClass= object_class_name Where object_class_name is the name of the person object class, for example: organizationalPerson. When all updates are complete, save and close the UserInfoConfig.xml file. Verify that there are not formatting errors by opening the file in a browser. If no mistakes are found, update the Docker or Kubernetes deployment for the settings to take effect. See Customizing business cards in Docker and Podman or Customizing business cards in Kubernetes . Parent Topic: Setting up business cards","title":"Configuring business cards using an LDAP directory"},{"location":"admin/config_buscard.html#config_buscard","text":"Configuring business cards is done in the UserInfoConfig.xml file in the community pod. Before you start setting up your business cards, ensure the following: The LDAP server is running and accessible by the Sametime server. All LDAP attributes needed by the business card are accessible for query through an anonymous connection or by using a specific bind account and password. If using an Domino LDAP, edit the server configuration settings to allow anonymous users to access required user details. In the Domino Administrator or Notes Client, click Configuration > All Server Documents > Configurations to access the All Servers document. Click Edit Configurations . Under the LDAP tab, you can view and add LDAP attributes that can be retrieved by anonymous users to the Anonymous users can query list. Configuration settings for business cards are in the UserInfoConfig.xml file in the community container or pod. For most environments, the UserInfoConfig.xml file works with default settings. You can override the default configuration settings by modifying the UserInfoConfig.xml file. The procedure to update the UserInfoConfig.xml file is different on Kubernetes and Docker. When modifying the XML file be sure to check the formatting using a browser. If there is an error with the formatting of the XML file, a business failure can occur. When using multiple LDAP servers, each LDAP server requires its own settings. By default, only the first server is configured during setup. To add additional LDAP servers, use the existing settings as a template. Locate the <StorageType=\u201dLDAP\u201d> section and copy everything between the <StorageType=\u201dLDAP\u201d> and </Storage> statements. Paste the statements at the end of the section below the </Storage> statement. This creates a new LDAP section. See Configuring additional LDAP servers on Kubernetes for information on configuring LDAP. Configure an authenticated bind. In some environments, not all the attributes are available to an anonymous bind, and an authenticated bind must be used. During the Sametime installation, anonymous binds to LDAP is configured by default. When a custom UserInfoConfig.xml file is being used, the LDAP bind credentials are being overridden. Bind credentials are located in the .env file for Docker and the sametime-global-secret in Kubernetes. Use the echo command to find the base64 encoded value for the user name and password. Specify the user name and password separated by a colon. For example, if the Bind user name is CN=stbind,O=example and the password is securePassword , enter the following command in a Linux shell: echo -n \u2018CN=stbind,O=example:securePassword\u2019 | base64 The results from the command is the value of a new argument called UserEncodedAuth.

The class can invoke different LDAP search filters depending on search criteria entered by users. The Search filter for resolving person names and the Search filter for resolving group names settings in the LDAP directory settings of the Sametime\u00ae Administration Tool define the LDAP directory search filters responsible for selecting user and group names from the LDAP directory. Note: You do not have to write Java classes to control the search behavior for both users and groups. You can use a Java class to control the search behavior for users while using a single LDAP search filter to control the search behavior for groups, or vice versa. The specific source code that you write to support customized LDAP searches is entirely dependent on your environment. This section provides a code sample to help you understand how to write the Java class appropriate for your environment. Note: The searched name must be escaped according to LDAP RFC2254 before adding it to the created LDAP filter. Use the escape and the isHex methods as is from the following example. The following example invokes different LDAP directory search filters based on the text string that is entered into the Sametime user interface by a user. The search filters invoked by the method are dependent on the directory schema and the search behavior needed for the environment. Assume that three different users want to add the user Victor Lazlow to their Sametime Connect Client buddy lists. Each of the three users searches for Victor Lazlow in a different way. The logic of the Java class dictates the results of these three user searches: User 1 Input: User 1 enters Victor L* into the Sametime client user interface to add Victor Lazlow to the Contacts list. Results: This search attempt returns an error because the Java class is programmed to return an error when the user enters a text string that includes an asterisk. User 2 Input: User 2 enters Victor_Lazlow@example.com into the Sametime client interface. Results: This search attempt succeeds and returns the value \"Victor_Lazlow@example.com\" (Victor Lazlow's email address) from the LDAP directory. The search attempt succeeds in this way because the Java class is programmed to return an LDAP search filter that can resolve an LDAP directory search to a user's email address. The Java class returns this email address search filter if the search text string entered by the end user includes the \"at\" character (@). User 3 Input: User 3 enters \"Victor L\" into the Sametime client interface. This search attempt succeeds and returns the common name (cn) directory attribute of \"Victor Lazlow.\" Results: The search attempt succeeds in this way because the Java class is programmed to return an LDAP search filter that can resolve an LDAP directory search to a user's common name (cn). The Java class returns this common name search filter if the search text string entered by the end user does not include either an asterisk or \"at\" (@) character. Sample code The code sample that follows shows the Java source code that produces this search behavior.

Parent Topic: Creating custom Java classes for searching LDAP","title":"Example Writing a Java class to filter searches for people and groups"},{"location":"admin/config_chat_ldap_java_people.html#config_chat_ldap_java_people","text":"If a single search filter is not adequate to resolve user or group name searches, you can write a Java\u2122 class containing a method that specifies exactly how directory searches are conducted. The class can invoke different LDAP search filters depending on search criteria entered by users. The Search filter for resolving person names and the Search filter for resolving group names settings in the LDAP directory settings of the Sametime\u00ae Administration Tool define the LDAP directory search filters responsible for selecting user and group names from the LDAP directory. Note: You do not have to write Java classes to control the search behavior for both users and groups. You can use a Java class to control the search behavior for users while using a single LDAP search filter to control the search behavior for groups, or vice versa. The specific source code that you write to support customized LDAP searches is entirely dependent on your environment. This section provides a code sample to help you understand how to write the Java class appropriate for your environment. Note: The searched name must be escaped according to LDAP RFC2254 before adding it to the created LDAP filter. Use the escape and the isHex methods as is from the following example. The following example invokes different LDAP directory search filters based on the text string that is entered into the Sametime user interface by a user. The search filters invoked by the method are dependent on the directory schema and the search behavior needed for the environment. Assume that three different users want to add the user Victor Lazlow to their Sametime Connect Client buddy lists. Each of the three users searches for Victor Lazlow in a different way. The logic of the Java class dictates the results of these three user searches: User 1 Input: User 1 enters Victor L* into the Sametime client user interface to add Victor Lazlow to the Contacts list. Results: This search attempt returns an error because the Java class is programmed to return an error when the user enters a text string that includes an asterisk. User 2 Input: User 2 enters Victor_Lazlow@example.com into the Sametime client interface. Results: This search attempt succeeds and returns the value \"Victor_Lazlow@example.com\" (Victor Lazlow's email address) from the LDAP directory. The search attempt succeeds in this way because the Java class is programmed to return an LDAP search filter that can resolve an LDAP directory search to a user's email address. The Java class returns this email address search filter if the search text string entered by the end user includes the \"at\" character (@). User 3 Input: User 3 enters \"Victor L\" into the Sametime client interface. This search attempt succeeds and returns the common name (cn) directory attribute of \"Victor Lazlow.\" Results: The search attempt succeeds in this way because the Java class is programmed to return an LDAP search filter that can resolve an LDAP directory search to a user's common name (cn). The Java class returns this common name search filter if the search text string entered by the end user does not include either an asterisk or \"at\" (@) character. Sample code The code sample that follows shows the Java source code that produces this search behavior. This code creates a Java class named StLdapCustomized that includes the peopleResolveFilter method. The if statements in the peopleResolveFilter method examine the text string entered by the user in the Sametime client user interface and return the appropriate LDAP search filter based on this text string. The comments in the source code explain the purpose of each if statement. public class StLdapCustomized { /** * String representing an escaped forward slash sign '\\' */ private final static String SLASH_SIGN_CONVERTED = \"\\\\5c\"; /** * String representing an escaped * sign '*' */ private final static String STAR_SIGN_CONVERTED = \"\\\\2a\"; /** * String representing an escaped opening bracket sign '(' */ private final static String OPENING_BRACKET_SIGN_CONVERTED = \"\\\\28\"; /** * String representing an escaped closing bracket sign ')' */ private final static String CLOSING_BRACKET_SIGN_CONVERTED = \"\\\\29\"; /** * Escape problematic characters in the name to match the LDAP filter escaping * criteria according to RFC2254 * rfc2254 - The String Representation of LDAP Search * @param name the name to escape * @return an escaped string */ private static String escape(String name) { StringBuffer escapedName = new StringBuffer(); for (int i=0; i< name.length(); ){ switch(name.charAt(i)){ case '\\\\': // if the next 2 chars are hex we don't need to escape if((i< name.length()-2) && isHex(name.charAt(i+1)) && isHex(name.charAt(i+2))){ escapedName.append('\\\\'); escapedName.append(name.charAt(++i)); escapedName.append(name.charAt(++i)); } else{ escapedName.append(SLASH_SIGN_CONVERTED); } i++; break; case '*': escapedName.append(STAR_SIGN_CONVERTED); i++; break; case '(': escapedName.append(OPENING_BRACKET_SIGN_CONVERTED); i++; break; case ')': escapedName.append(CLOSING_BRACKET_SIGN_CONVERTED); i++; break; default: escapedName.append(name.charAt(i)); i++; } } return escapedName.toString(); } /** * Verifies whether this char is a hex char * @param c * @return */ private static boolean isHex(char c){ boolean hex = true; hex = !( Character.digit(c, 16) == -1); return hex; } /** * Generates a search filter for finding a user, given the user's * name. * The searched name is escaped according to LDAP filters escaping rules. * The checks on the searched name format should be done before escaping the value. * @param name The user's name as provided by the Sametime client. * @return The search filter, or null if the name is invalid. * */ public static String peopleResolveFilter (String name) { String escapedName; // prevent users from adding their own wildcards if (name.indexOf('*') != -1) return null; // if name looks like email, do not search with wildcards, and only search in mail attribute if (name.indexOf('@') != -1) { escapedName = escape(name); return \"(&(objectclass=person)(mail=\" + escapedName + \")) \"; } // otherwise, search as CN with wildcard escapedName = escape(name); return \"(&(objectclass=person) (cn=\" + escapedName + \"*))\"; } } After writing your Java class, complete the tasks in this section to implement it in either Docker or Kubernetes.

For example, altCommunityConfig.managedIDs=altHost1,altHost2 defines two alternate communities named altHost1 and altHost 2. altCommunityConfig.altHost.altHostID.targetCommunityHost String Required. The host name of the alternate community. altHostID represents the ID you defined for the alternate community in the managedIds preference, such as altHost1. altCommunityConfig.altHost.altHostID.enabled Boolean. Default is true. Enables the alternate community configuration. altCommunityConfig.altHost.altHostID.weight Integer. Default is 0. The weight of the alternate community configuration relative to other alternate communities. The higher the value, the greater the weight. For example, a connection to an alternate community with a weight of 2 is tried before one with a weight of 0. Regardless of the assigned weight, the client attempts a connection to the last successful alternate community first. altCommunityConfig.altHost.altHostID.type String. The default is postDefaultConfig. Determines if the alternate community connection is tried before the default community or after. A value of postDefaultConfig attempts the connection after trying to connect to the default community. A value of preDefaultConfig attempts to connect to the alternate community first. altCommunityConfig.altHost.altHostID.attemptCount Integer. The default is 1. Sets the number of times the client attempts to connect to the alternate community before trying another community. altCommunityConfig.altHost.altHostID.fallbackOnly String By default, this preference is not set and the client attempts a connection to the last successful alternate community first. If you set the preference fallbackOnly for a specific alternate community, it will never be retried first, even if it was the last successful connection. altCommunityConfig.altHost.altHostID.host String Defines a secondary alternate community host to connect to if the host defined in the targetCommunityHost preference cannot be reached. For example, if the targetCommunityHost is im1.example.com, the host could point to im2.example.com. altCommunityConfig.altHost.altHostID.authServerUrl String Specifies the server URL for Single Sign-on authentication. altCommunityConfig.altHost.altHostID.authType String Defines the method used for Single sign-on authentication. Use TAM-SPNEGO for SPNEGO authentication or ST-DOMINO-SSO for Domino authentication within Notes. altCommunityConfig.altHost.altHostID.port Integer The port to use if other than the default 1533. altCommunityConfig.altHost.altHostID.connectionType String. Valid values include direct, tls-direct, http-direct, socks4-proxy, socks5-proxy, http-proxy, https-proxy, reverse-proxy. Determines how the client connects to the alternate community. The default is direct . altCommunityConfig.altHost.altHostID.proxyHost String Specifies the initial proxy host value for the alternate community. altCommunityConfig.altHost.altHostID.proxyPort Integer The port of the proxy. altCommunityConfig.altHost.altHostID.loginByToken Boolean Determines if the client logs in by token. If the token login fails and the password is available, the client attempts password-based authentication instead. tryLastSuccesfulConfigFirst Boolean. Default is true. Determines if the client first tries the alternate community it last connected to successfully. If you change the value to false, the client always attempts Connections to the alternate communities in the default priority order set in the managedIDs list, regardless of which alternate community connection was successful last.

All rules related to XML files apply. Additionally, the following items should be considered: Do not create any extra blank lines in the file. To use comments, precede the line with a hashtag (#). Do not use the tab key to indent lines, use two spaces instead. Do not copy text from the help center and use it in your file because it may copy some of the encoding from the page and cause the file to fail. It is helpful to use an XML editor, but a plain text editor can be used as well. If using a plain text editor, it is important to check the file extension when saving (must be .xml not .txt). There is an example managed-settings.xml file attached to the troubleshooting article which can be used to test managed settings in place of creating a new one. This procedure demonstrates how to create the managed-settings.xml and define chat history preferences for enabling automatically save chats for 7 days. Procedure Create a new file with UTF-8 encoding named managed-settings.xml. Note: No other file names are supported. Place the opening and ending statements in the file: <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <ManagedSettings> </ManagedSettings> In between the <ManagedSettings> tags is where the settings must be defined. Thus the last line of the file should be </ManagedSettings> . Review the settings that can be defined. For this example, the chat logging preferences should be changed. Note: You can define other settings. This example is to only demonstrate the syntax. Place the settingGroup tags in between the <ManagedSettings> tags. <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <ManagedSettings> <settingGroup name=\"\"> </settingGroup> </ManagedSettings> On the preferences documentation pages, some tables provide the names of the settingGroup. For example, in the Chat Preferences , table 2 is for Chat History Preferences. The settingGroup name is com.ibm.collaboration.realtime.chat.logging. The settings that are used for this example are \u201cdays.storage.max\u201d and \u201clogging.default\u201d. These configure the user\u2019s client to automatically log all chats on the client-side and retain them for 7 days.

Refer to the table for the setting name. In the example from above, the two settings used in the example are \u201cdays.storage.max\u201d and \u201clogging.default\u201d. These are defined in a tag called <setting name=\u201d\u201d value=\u201d\u201d/>. These lines are indented with two spaces. <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <ManagedSettings> <settingGroup name=\"com.ibm.collaboration.realtime.chat.logging\"> <setting name=\u201dlogging.default\u201d value=\u201d0\u201d/> <setting name=\u201ddays.storage.max\u201d value=\u201d7\u201d/> </settingGroup> </ManagedSettings> You can define settings from other settingGroups in the same file. Ensure that the formatting of spacing remains the same. For example, add a contact list preference to sort groups alphabetically by default. These settings are documented in the Contact list preferences topic. Open the help center topic and locate the settingGroup name. Locate the setting name.

The settingGroup tag has an attribute called lastModDate which when present every change to a setting group must also be accompanied by a change to the lastModDate attribute or the new values are not updated. If you do not use the lastModDate attribute, the values are always updated, even if they are not new. The format for the lastModDate value uses java.text.SimpleDateFormat timestamp format. The syntax is YYYYMMDDThhmmss , where YYYY=year, MM=month, DD, hh=hours, mm=minutes, and ss=seconds. The values following the T are optional. For example: <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <ManagedSettings> <settingGroup name=\"com.ibm.collaboration.realtime.chat.logging\" lastModDate=\u201d2021-02-11T17:39:21-05\u201d> <setting name=\u201dlogging.default\u201d value=\u201d0\u201d/> <setting name=\u201ddays.storage.max\u201d value=\u201d7\u201d/> </settingGroup> </ManagedSettings> Each <setting> tag can have the following optional attributes: isLocked : Boolean. The default value is true . If true, the setting is read-only and any changes that a user or application make to the value set by you, the administrator, are prevented or later overwritten. If this attribute is set to false , the administrator's setting is treated as a default value that can be changed by the user. ``` {#codeblock_i5l_5fp_jzb} <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <ManagedSettings> <settingGroup name=\"com.ibm.collaboration.realtime.chat.logging\"> <setting name=\u201dlogging.default\u201d value=\u201d0\u201d isLocked=\u201dfalse\u201d/> <setting name=\u201ddays.storage.max\u201d value=\u201d7\u201d isLocked=\u201dtrue\u201d/> </settingGroup> </ManagedSettings> ``` In the above example, all chats are saved automatically initially until the user changes the setting, and the chat history is retained for 7 days. Users are not able to change this setting because it is locked. overwriteUnlocked : Boolean. The default value is false. By default, a setting that is specified as being unlocked is treated as a default and would not overwrite any existing value on the client. This is to avoid undoing changes that the user might have legitimately made. However, if this setting is set to true, the unlocked value is overwritten with this new value even if it means clearing the user's existing value. overwriteUnlocked : Boolean.

The default value is false. This attribute applies only when you automatically update client preferences with the managed-settings.xml file. Setting this to true creates a user prompt to restart the client as soon as the managed setting is applied. Use this optional attribute only if a restart of the client is required to activate the preference. The restart occurs only if the setting that includes this attribute is updated.

The default LDAP configuration works for most environments. The settings are based on an Domino LDAP deployments that has not been modified. If using another LDAP environment, you might need to override the default settings. You can customize how the Sametime server interacts with LDAP by modifying the StCommunityConfig.xml file located in the Community container. The UserInfoConfig.xml file also contains LDAP settings that can be customized for business cards. For LDAP security, see the security section of the help center.

When you connect to more than one LDAP server, it is important for the names to be unique. If you are trying to achieve high availability to the same directory, use a load balancer to front-end the connection between the multiple LDAP servers. Configure the cluster for the first LDAP server. This must be done when the cluster was installed. You must know the host name, port and optional bind credentials for each LDAP server. If you are using a secure connection to LDAP, the LDAP server\u2019s certificate for each server must be stored in the same .p12 trust store file. You must create a secret containing the trust store that holds each LDAP server\u2019s certificate. The Docker and Podman commands are similar. The only difference is that docker precedes the command when issued in a Docker environment and podman precedes the name in a Podman environment. Example commands used in the Sametime documentation are shown using Docker. For Podman, change docker to podman. When more than one LDAP is defined in an environment, they are searched in the order defined in the StCommunityConfig.xml and UserInfoConfig.xml files. When you define each LDAP server, the order in which they are listed in the configuration is the same order in which they are searched. The process described in this procedure involves copying the StCommunityConfig.xml and UserInfoConfig.xml files from the Sametime community (chat) container. These copied configurations overrides the default LDAP configuration settings. The LDAP servers are defined within each configuration file. Docker-compose commands are used to pull the existing configuration files from the Sametime server to your local machine. Modify these files locally with the required settings, then add a volume under the community section of the docker-compose.yml file to enable the modified settings. This procedure is to configure Sametime to connect to two or more separate LDAP servers that have unique names. Change to the sametime_installation_directory directory. Identify the chat-server container ID by running the command 'docker container ls' and finding the chat-server IMAGE. The NAME is the container name, as an example: sametime-community-1. Pull a copy of the StCommunityConfig.xml and UserInfoConfig.xml from the chat-server container by running the below command, where container_name is the container name for the chat-server identified in step 2. docker cp <container_name>:/local/notesdata/UserInfoConfig.xml . docker cp <container_name>:/local/notesdata/StCommunityConfig.xml . Find the base64 encoded value of your bind credentials.

Duplicate the line that begins with StorageDetails . The order in which you list your StorageDetails statement is the search order to be used. HostName : The fully qualified host name or IP address of the second LDAP server. Port : If using unsecured LDAP, specify the port number used by LDAP. If you are using secure LDAP, you don't need to modify this field. UserName : Set this field to empty double-quotes ( \u201c\u201d ). Password : Set this field to empty double-quotes (\u201c\u201d). If using an authenticated bind, add a new parameter after UserName and Password called UserEncodedAuth= and set it to the value that was determined in a previous step. BaseDN : Define a base DN for searching the directory. If left blank, the entire directory is searched. SearchFilter : SearchFilter Modify the search filter if needed.

Configure the cluster for the first LDAP server. This must be done when the cluster was installed. You must know the host name, port and optional bind credentials for each LDAP server. If you are using a secure connection to LDAP, the LDAP server\u2019s certificate for each server must be stored in the same .p12 trust store file. You must create a secret containing the trust store that holds each LDAP server\u2019s certificate. The Docker and Podman commands are similar. The only difference is that docker precedes the command when issued in a Docker environment and podman precedes the name in a Podman environment. Example commands used in the Sametime documentation are shown using Docker. For Podman, change docker to podman. When more than one LDAP is defined in an environment, they are searched in the order defined in the StCommunityConfig.xml and UserInfoConfig.xml files. When you define each LDAP server, the order in which they are listed in the configuration is the same order in which they are searched. The process described in this procedure involves copying the StCommunityConfig.xml and UserInfoConfig.xml files from the Sametime community (chat) container. These copied configurations overrides the default LDAP configuration settings. The LDAP servers are defined within each configuration file. Docker-compose commands are used to pull the existing configuration files from the Sametime server to your local machine. Modify these files locally with the required settings, then add a volume under the community section of the docker-compose.yml file to enable the modified settings. This procedure is to configure Sametime to connect to two or more separate LDAP servers that have unique names. Change to the sametime_installation_directory directory. Identify the chat-server container ID by running the command 'docker container ls' and finding the chat-server IMAGE. The NAME is the container name, as an example: sametime-community-1. Pull a copy of the StCommunityConfig.xml and UserInfoConfig.xml from the chat-server container by running the below command, where container_name is the container name for the chat-server identified in step 2. docker cp <container_name>:/local/notesdata/UserInfoConfig.xml . docker cp <container_name>:/local/notesdata/StCommunityConfig.xml .

Note that the settings are implemented differently depending on the platform: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, and Openshift. For details on configuring these parameters, see Configuring the sametime.ini file . If the Sametime server is running when you set or modify a sametime.ini file setting, the setting takes effect after you restart the Sametime server. The following sections, describe optional configuration settings to use with SAML authentication. FIPS 140-2 compliance The default Sametime configuration is not FIPS 140-2 compliant. If your Sametime deployment requires FIPS 140-2 compliance, set FIPS 140-2 compliance to true in the TLS configuration, under the Server application connections column. This affects both TLS and SAML. For more information about applying settings in a TLS configuration, see Implementing the Global TLS Scope . Security level The default configuration imposes no restrictions on the use of cryptographic algorithms and certificate strength. If strong cryptography is required, change the Minimum security level setting in the TLS configuration, in the Server application connections column. This affects both TLS and SAML. For more information about applying settings in a TLS configuration, see Implementing the Global TLS Scope . Alternatively, you can override the default values by configuring the sametime.ini file. STI__Config__STSAML_SECURITY_LEVEL=numeric value between 0 and 4, inclusive A value of 0 implies no restriction on the cryptographic algorithms or certificate strength. The higher the value, the stronger the security level enforcement. Any security strength higher than 0 causes SAML validation to fail in case the SAML signature validation involves weak cryptography that does not comply with the minimum security level. For a list of available security levels, see Implementing the Global TLS Scope . Trusted audiences The SAML identity provider (IdP) might optionally address the assertion to a limited set of audiences. This information is included in the assertion element, according to the SAML standard, and typically contains one or more URLs that identify the trusted audiences. By default, Sametime ignores this information, and validates the assertion whether or not the Sametime Community Server is a member of the specified audiences. If the trusted audiences setting is present in a configuration, and the assertion contains a trusted audience condition, the Community Server matches the assertion audience condition against the trusted audiences setting, and validation fails if there is no match. The trusted audiences are set in the sametime.ini file. STI__Config__STSAML_TRUSTED_AUDIENCES=trusted-audiences The value of this setting is a comma-separated list of one or more host names. Each audience in the assertion condition is matched against each trusted audience in the configuration. At least one match is needed for passing the condition. Audience matching is performed by comparing the host portion of the audience URL to the host name in the configuration. If the strings are equal (ignoring letter case) there is a match. It is possible to set a trusted-audience string with wild card domain components, using the asterisk character (*) to represent a wild card domain component. For example, this setting uses the asterisk. STI__Config__STSAML_TRUSTED_AUDIENCES=*.example.com And the following audience condition in the SAML assertion: <saml:Audience>https://sametime.example.com/saml/<saml:Audience> Given this configuration and audience condition, matching passes, because sametime.example.com matches *.example.com . In another example, sametime.example.com would not match *.com because the number of domain components is different. That is sametime.example.com contains three components, while *.com contains two. Response signature validation The SAML authentication token contains a SAML response element, which in turn contains a child assertion element. According to the SAML standard, either element can be signed. The default Sametime configuration does not require a valid response signature if the underlying assertion has a valid signature.

Enable SAML authentication for the deployment as explained in Setting up SSO using SAML . This task applies to the Sametime Connect and Embedded clients; it does not affect web or mobile clients. This topic includes parameters to pre-configure the clients for SAML, so that the users do not need to know any of the details. During SAML log in process, Sametime redirects client connections to the Identity Provider (IdP) URL. If the IdP passes the user through multiple sites, Sametime stops loading the page and generates the following error message in the log: URL redirected_url is not in the trusted sites list. Ensure that Sametime Connect and Embedded clients can connect using SAML by adding the trusted site's URL to the client preferences before installing or updating the clients. This is the URL that you assigned in the STSAML_TRUSTED_AUDIENCES setting, as explained in Configuration settings related to SAML authentication . For more information on configuring client installation packages, see Configuring Sametime Connect client preferences with the Expeditor managed settings framework . Alternatively, users can manually enable SAML authentication by modifying settings in the client. For more information, see Enabling SAML authentication in installed clients . This topic outlines the steps required to determine the settings used in the plugin_customization.ini file. As you find the parameter name and value for each setting, save them in a temporary location, which is added to the plugin_customization.ini to configure the clients. Determine the SAML prefix value. The Sametime clients support connecting to more than one Sametime environment, which could possibly have different IdPs. Therefore, the parameters defined in the plugin_customization.ini file are prefixed with the host name of the server. To determine the parameter prefix value: The first part of the parameter prefix is com.ibm.collaboration.realtime.community/ . The second part of the parameter prefix is the fully qualified host name of the Sametime server followed by a dot. For example: sametime.example.com. For example, if the Sametime host name is sametime.example.com , the resulting prefix using the example is the prefix added to each parameters. com.ibm.collaboration.realtime.community/sametime.example.com . Determine the IdP URL parameter name and value. To determine the parameter name, use the prefix determined in the previous step and append idp= . For example: com.ibm.collaboration.realtime.community/sametime.example.com.idp= Set the value of the parameter to the IdP URL. To find the IdP URL, refer to the Setting up SSO using SAML . For example: com.ibm.collaboration.realtime.community/sametime.example.com.idp=https://idp.example.com/exampletenant&appid=1234?TARGET=https://sametime.example.com Determine if you should use a form based login or a browser based login type. The parameter name is the prefix determined in step one followed by idp.type= For example: com.ibm.collaboration.realtime.community/sametime.example.com.idp.type= The Sametime Connect and Embedded clients have two options for displaying the user login details: With the Browser option, the login window changes and displays the Identity Provider (IdP) login page when the log in is redirected to the IdP. This option should be used by most configurations. With the Form option, the user have a UI option that must include the form field values. If Form is selected as the login type, you must provide the names of the fields in the form. Skip this step if Browser is selected. Browse to your IdP URL, view the HTML source of the log-in form and collect the following values. prefix.idp.form.username.tag : The value in the name attribute of the Intranet ID label's input statement. This value is user ID. prefix.idp.form.password.tag : The value in the name attribute of the Password label's input statement. This value is password . prefix.idp.form.submit.tag : The value in the name attribute of the Sign in input statement. This value is the submit tag. For example, if you browse to the example IdP URL, the following shows where the values appear in the sample HTML source. Based on the example, the resulting settings and values are: com.ibm.collaboration.realtime.community/sametime.example.com.idp.form.username.tag=userID com.ibm.collaboration.realtime.community/sametime.example.com.idp.form.password.tag=password com.ibm.collaboration.realtime.community/sametime.example.com.idp.form.submit.tag=submit_button Set the samlTrustedSites parameter to list all redirecting URLs used by your IdP. Separate multiple URLs with a comma (,). If your IdP does not use redirecting URLs, leave this setting blank.

The process is different for Kubernetes and Docker. One user access URL for the Sametime server is needed for the identity provider (IdP). An IdP is a service that stores and verifies the identity of users. In previous Sametime releases, the community services for rich clients was separate from the web chat and meeting services. In Sametime 12, all services are under the Sametime server. Because there is only one server, only one host name is required for all three types of user access: rich clients, web chat, and meetings. To use SAML, the IdP administrator must create a federated partnership or relying party trust for the Sametime server. Additionally, the user access URL for the Sametime configuration and a certificate to be trusted by the Sametime server must be provided. If you are upgrading from a previous Sametime version, you might want to keep using the same host names. Use the following scenarios for IdP requirement guidance. Scenario 1 : If one host name is used for accessing rich clients, web chat clients, and meeting clients, then only one SAML partnership or relying party trust is needed. Scenario 2 : If using a different host name for rich clients and web chat clients, then include the following SAML partnerships or relying party trusts: - One for the chat host name that is exposed to the Sametime Mux service - One for the web chat host name defined for ingress Scenario 3 : If using a different host name for rich client, web chat clients, and meeting clients, then include the following SAML partnerships or relying party trusts: - One for the chat host name that is exposed to the Sametime Mux service - One for the web chat host name defined for ingress **Note:** Meeting authentication is processed through the web chat proxy and no specific SAML partnership is required for the meeting host name. Each IdP varies in implementation and terminology. The following are some guidelines for configuring your IdP. Only IdP initiated sign-on is supported. SAML assertion consumer service URL : The fully-qualified URL of the Sametime server, add /stwebapi/user/connect. For example, https://sametime.example.com/stwebapi/user/connect at the end of the URL. : If you are using a separate name for the web chat client, you can use the webchat host name in the URL. For example: https://webchat.example.con/stwebapi/user/connect. : If the Community chat server has a separate host name from webchat or rich clients, use the community host name in the URL, for example: https://chat.example.com . Relay State : Specify the same value as the what is specified for the SAML assertion consumer service URL. Log out URL : Do not specify a value for this property. The SAML logout specification is not supported in Sametime. Name ID : Specify the attribute from the IdP that contains the user's email address. Certificate for TLS : A secure connection to the IdP is required and the IdP administrator must provide the certificate for Sametime to trust. If you have multiple relying party trusts, the IdP might have separate certificates for each host name trusted or a single certificate. Such as in the case of separated host names. If there are more than one certificate, each certificate and its full chain must be added to the trust store.

Both third party and self-signed certificates are supported. Note: If you are supporting mobile clients, use a third-party certificate. A trust store needed for creating outbound connections. The trust store is used by the client side of a TLS connection to validate the server's certificate. With mutual authentication, the trust store is also used by the server to validate the client's certificate. A key store needed for accepting inbound connections. The key store is used by the server side of a TLS connection to store the server certificate as well as chain certificates, if any chain certificates exist. During client authentication, the key store is used by the client to store its client certificate and chain certificates, if any exist. All Sametime encryption is done at TLS 1.2, which can be overridden if a lower version is required. The following tables describe the required and optional configuration settings in the sametime.ini. To configure the sametime.ini file, see Configuring the sametime.ini file on Docker or Podman . Parameter Description STI_Config_ST_TLS_TRUST_STORE_TYPE The trust store type.

STI_Config_ST_TLS_SECURITY_LEVEL The required security level. The minimum security level controls compliance with the security standards NIST SP800-131a and NSA Suite B. 0 : No requirement 1 : NIST SP800 -131a \u201cTransition mode\u201d 2 : NIST SP800-131a \u201cStrict mode\u201d 3 : NSA Suite B 128-bit level 4 : NSA Suite B 192-bit level | |STI_Config_ST_TLS_MAX_SESSION_AGE|The amount of time before re-negotiating a session. The time to keep a session, in seconds, before deleting it from cache. -1 : No cache, which is generally sufficient for most Sametime deployments. This is the default value. 0 : No limit on the age of cached sessions. | |STI_Config_ST_TLS_SESSION_CACHE_SIZE|Applies only to inbound connections. The number of TLS sessions that a server keeps in memory, for session reuse. This option tells the server to keep a cache of the TLS session state after the connection is closed. -1 : No session cache, which is generally sufficient for most Sametime deployments. This is the default value. 0 : No limit on the number of cached sessions. It is useful after temporary network outage, when the client attempts to reconnect to the server, by reusing the session that was established earlier. If the server finds the session in cache, the handshake is abbreviated, consuming less resources. If the session is not in cache, a new session is established, including the full handshake. | |STI_Config_ST_TLS_SESSION_CACHE_TIME|Applies only to inbound connections. The maximum age of a TLS session, in seconds before renegotiating a session, If the same session is used longer than this setting, a new session is renegotiated over the same connection. The default value 0 means that there is no session renegotiation.| |STI_Config_ST_TLS_MIN_PROTOCOL_VERSION=|The oldest version of the SSL/TLS protocol to negotiate during handshake. The default value is TLS 1.2. 0x300 : SSL v3 0x301 : TLS v1.0 0x302 : TLS v1.1 0x303 : TLS v1.2.

The comparison takes place during the TLS handshake, when receiving a certificate from the peer, when the client receives the server certificate, or when the server receives a client certificate. The name in the peer certificate is typically specified in either the subject CN (common name) or the subjectAltName field. Validation passes if there is at least one match between the name in the peer certificate and a name in the trusted hosts list. A trusted host name may contain the wild card character (*) which can be used to compare domain components rather than the entire string as a whole. The comparison process follows the rules described in section 3.1 of RFC 2818 . Certificate subject validation only applies when receiving a certificate from the peer. In order to ensure that a server performs this comparison, the server must require a client certificate, by setting ST_TLS_CLIENT_AUTH=2 . | |STI_Config_ST_TLS_MIRROR_TRUSTED_HOSTS|This parameter is needed when you have a key store with multiple key certificates. In which case, each certificate has a different alias in the key store. On the server side, specify the alias of the certificate that identifies the server.

After following the steps about accessing the container images from Harbor, you can configure that access token with Helm: helm registry login -u your\\_email\\_address hclcr.io When prompted for a password, use the access token from your account profile in Harbor. Use the helm install command to run the managed chart. helm install install\\_name oci://hclcr.io/st/sametime-premium-single-node Any customizations that should be applied to the deployment can be supplied in a custom values.yaml file rather than using --set options. To see the default values, examples, and documentation about settings you might want to customize, use one of the command: ``` {#codeblock_xmq_xpf_pzb} helm show values chart-name.tgz - ``` {#codeblock_vlc_ypf_pzb} helm show values oci://hclcr.io/st/sametime-premium-single-node You can copy-paste and modify any of the default values and then apply those settings like this: helm install sametime sametime-premium-single-node-12.0.2.tgz -f values.yaml where values.yaml is the file you have customized. Alternatively, you can run: ./prepareDeployment.yaml values.yaml and follow the prompts to produce a new values.yaml file with your customized configuration. You can use that as a starting point to make further edits as needed, for example. See t_meetings_configure_deployment.md for more information about how to respond to the prompts in the prepareDeployment tool. Note: when using the prepareDeployment tool with a managed chart, there are additional prompts about whether the embedded mongo/openldap/coturn/nginx-ingress should be deployed.

The LDAP server must be running before deploying Sametime. System requirements Sametime works with V3-compliant LDAP servers. Performance LDAP performance is critical to a successful deployment. Sametime is going to put a heavy load on LDAP. Consider the performance requirements of all Sametime LDAP traffic: Client lookups Authentication Contact list management Invitations to meetings Business card features Mobile clients Part of your deployment plan may include adding more cluster members to the LDAP cluster. To minimize the burden on LDAP, use minimal search filters wherever possible. Log in choices such as name, email address, employee ID, and so on, create longer search filters and greater performance loads on LDAP. When planning for LDAP, don't forget Single Sign-On (SSO). Talk to your company's application teams about SSO. Propose a standard way that you allow people to log in to keep logins simple and minimal. All applications should utilize LDAP in the same way. If applications have different search filters, then this creates search problems and authentication problems. Mail attribute Sametime requires the LDAP mail attribute in each person record. The mail attribute provides performance advantages since translation between attributes is not required; it also provides consistency and integrity by using a common and well-understood attribute. This attribute is not required for anonymous (guest) users. The attribute must be a unique string, which preferably follows the syntax and length restrictions of email addresses. In addition, the mail attribute must be populated for every user to support audio and video communications. The mail attribute is not used for email purposes and does not have to be assigned as a user name for logging into Sametime. Instead, it serves as a common attribute between the various Sametime subsystems, such as calendar integration, business cards, LDAP, and REST APIs. Multiple directory support Multiple directories are supported with the following restrictions: Groups may only contain members present in the same directory server and base DN specified in the LDAP Server document. Sametime does not support mixed groups at this time. Multiple replicas of the same directory in the stconfig.nsf database are not supported. For effective load balancing, you should route LDAP traffic through a load balancer. If the browse feature is enabled on the server, certain features such as LDAP time-outs or the maximum number of search results returned may need to be disabled. If you use multiple LDAP repositories, you must ensure that the base entries do not overlap, as that causes problems when Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is enabled. For example, the following base entries have a field in common, so they overlap: o=renovations o=sales,o=renovations These base entries use different fields and are acceptable: o=renovations,c=us o=sales Contact lists Sametime might experience difficulties when users include large public groups in their contact lists. To avoid problems, limit the size of public groups used with Sametime to 1000 users. Upgrade considerations If you are considering moving from a native Domino directory to an LDAP directory, you must convert the user\u2019s names in the vpuserinfo.nsf file to LDAP format.

If you prefer to use a local Docker repository, move the Sametime images from the product download file into the repository. Download the HCL Sametime installation file from the HCL Software download portal. The compressed file contains Sametime images, managed charts, scripts, configuration files and more. Extract the zip file to any directory on the master Kubernetes host itself or on a machine which has management access to the Kubernetes cluster. Change to that directory and load the docker images into your docker registry using the following command. ./load.sh The load script extracts the docker images to the local host by default. When prompted, specify your Docker registry host FQDN. This can be a cloud provider registry or a private registry accessible to all of the nodes. If you do not have your own registry, run the load script on each node in the Kubernetes cluster and use the script defaults. Note: If the commands fails accessing the Docker daemon, you can run the following command: sudo ./load.sh Using the sudo command temporarily gives you administrator privileges.

The Sametime\u00ae client may have a community for each host; updating each to the same new host name would result in duplicate overlapping communities. To ensure that duplicate overlapping communities are consolidated into one, set this attribute to true. id Yes The unique ID of the managed community. This setting should be the same value as the \"host\" attribute. host Yes The host to manage. The client only updates communities whose host matches the host of the managed community. newHost No Attribute used to update the host of a community that matches the \"host\" attribute. This is the new host to connect to. The attribute only applies to \"update\" type managed community actions. The user's contact list is assumed to be valid for the new community. If the contact list is not valid, use the \"reset\" managed community action instead. name No The name of the community. Not recommended. To set the community ID, use ST_COMMUNITY_ID in the server's sametime.ini to set the community name for all clients. savePassword No Whether or not to save the password. Set the value to \"true\" to save the password. loginAtStartup No Whether or not to automatically log in. Set the value to \"true\" to log in automatically. useGlobalConnContext No Whether or not to use the global connection context. You must set this to \"true\" if you are updating connectionType to a value other than \"direct\". connectionType No The connection type corresponds to the options in the Connection settings page. Valid values include useBrowserSettings, direct, tls-direct, http-direct, socks4-proxy, socks5-proxy, http-proxy, and reverse-proxy. authServerUrl No The server URL for SSO authentication. authType No The authentication type for SSO. Value can either be TAM-SPNEGO or ST-DOMINO-SSO . port No The port to use if it is not the default 1533. proxyHost No The hostname of the proxy. proxyPort No The port of the proxy. loginByToken No Whether or not to log in by token. Set the value to \"true\" to log in by token. Note that if the token login fails and the password is available, the password-based authentication will proceed. sendKeepAlive No Whether or not to send the keep alive signal. Set the value to \"true\" to send the keep alive signal. keepAliveInterval No The interval at which to send the keep alive signal. Attribute Required? Description managed-community-id Yes The unique ID of the managed-community. Use the same value as the \"host\" attribute of the managed community type Yes The type of action. Values can be \"update\", \"add\", \"delete\" or \"reset\".- Add actions result in the addition of secondary communities. - Delete actions result in the deletion of secondary communities. The default community cannot be deleted. - Update actions result in an update to communities whose host value match the host value of the managed community. If no attributes are different, the update action does not result in any change. - Reset actions are used to reset the client configuration to a new default community. If a reset action is found, it is applied before any other action type and no other actions are processed. The user is prompted to restart, but may opt not to. The managed community referenced by the reset action represents the new default community that is to be used when the user next restarts. | |restart|No|By default, update actions only result in a restart if the host name is changed. Add this optional attribute and set the value to \"true\" to restart the client after other update events. To prevent the default restart after the host name is changed, add this attribute, but set it to \"false.\"| |applyDefaultCommunityUsername|No|Attribute that can be used with an \"add\" type managed community action to indicate whether or not the default community user name should be applied to the new community when it is added. Set the value to \"true\" apply the default community user name.| |createNewConfig|No|Optional attribute for use with the reset action type. When you set this to \"true,\" the previous default community is completely replaced by the new community. The user name and password are empty, requiring the user to repopulate these values. Without this attribute, or with the attribute set to false, the new default community configuration enabled with a reset action retains the user name, password, and connection options of the former default community.|","title":"Managed community settings"},{"location":"admin/managed_community.html#sample-managed-community-configs-file","text":"The following sample file adds a new community and updates two others.

You can deploy multiple front ends on different physical and virtual nodes pointing to the same back end in order to distribute load and survive a node outage. High availability is not supported for active meetings, but failover is supported. If a server hosting a meeting goes down, users who are in meetings on that server are briefly interrupted. The client reconnection timer reconnects the clients and distributes them to an available node. In some circumstances, a server that stops responding causes a client to disconnect from a meeting. Users can reconnect to the meeting from their recent meetings list and rejoin the meeting on an available server. Sametime can be expanded to more than one geography or another network by deploying multiple video bridges. This is different from deploying multiple video nodes, which are all co-located. When you deploy multiple video bridges the user receives audio and video from the video bridge that is located the closest to them. For more details, see Configuring autoscaling for video . For sizing and deployment related questions, contact an HCL support professional by completing the Talk to a Technical Expert form. Docker Meetings are sized based on what is happening in the environment at any given time. For Docker deployments, there are many variables, including the CPU and memory size of the Docker instance. A large Docker instance can support up to 200 concurrent peak users, but that does not take into consideration how many of the meetings are being recorded. Meeting recordings are CPU intensive. A Docker instance is better suited for a small department or focused team than an enterprise-size deployment. Kubernetes If you are deploying Sametime to your entire organization, Kubernetes is a better choice than Docker. The Kubernetes autoscaling feature provides the flexibility needed in an enterprise deployment. Autoscaling is a feature in which a cluster adjusts the number of nodes based on current usage and monitoring. In Kubernetes environments, a horizontal pod autoscaler is leveraged to automatically scale the environment upon demand. There are two configurations: one for video and one for recorders. When you create your node pools for video and recorder it is important to estimate how many nodes are needed. Video nodes are dedicated to a single video pod Recorder nodes are dedicated to the recorder pod You can either have a node dedicated to one recorder or you can size your recorder node pool instances to support more than one recorder per node.

Media quality and network connectivity performance How are media streams transferred? Is there any instance where this would occur peer to peer? : All media traffic is routed through the Sametime server. If I need external access to meetings, in which firewall zone do I place the Sametime Meeting server? : See Determining where to install Sametime . Are there any considerations for the network if I have a firewall? : See Planning the network topology and connectivity . What is the recommended bandwidth for comfortable usage? : Whether you are attending online meetings, video conferences, or virtual gatherings, ensuring a reliable and smooth connection is key. Calculation can be tricky and is dependent on the business scale. For small organizations, 1 Gbits/s is often enough. For larger organizations, 10 Gbits/s or more is recommended. For large organizations that use multiple bridges for multiple deployments, 10 Gbits/s link per bridge is recommended. For more information, see the Jitsi Meet Handbook . Chats within a meeting How long do chats in the meeting remain? : There are two places that chats are displayed. For authenticated users who are logged into the server, they see the chats in the Sametime clients as a group chat that includes the meeting participants. The chat persists if the user does not close the chat. : For meetings where users are guests, or authenticated users are not logged into a Sametime client, the meeting chat is only inside the meeting room. When the meeting concludes, the meeting room chats are deleted from the meeting room. Can I make the chats persist from one meeting to the next? : When the meeting concludes, the meeting room chats are deleted from the meeting room. Meeting chats do not persist to the next time the same meeting URL is used. Can I enable logging of the chats inside the meeting? : The user can log the chats only if they log into the server using a Sametime client. There are three ways the user can log these chats: - The Sametime Connect client or embedded client have a client-side chat logging feature enabled to save a local transcript. - The user enables persistent chats on the server and clients supporting persistent chats are in use, these chats are stored on the server in MongoDB. They are subject to the persistent chat configuration. - The server-side chat logging is enabled and chats are stored in the configured method. Authentication Which authentication methods are supported? : The Sametime server handles all authentication requests. Any supported authentication model you configure on the Sametime server is supported for Meetings. How can I disable guest (anonymous) access to meetings? : See Disabling guest access . Which types of SSO are supported with meetings? : LTPA and SAML with LTPA are supported. See Enabling Single Sign-on . Recordings Where are recordings stored? : Recordings are stored in a persistent volume which is configured when Sametime is installed. For more information, refer to Creating the persistent volume . How can you disable meeting recordings? : See Managing recording options . What type of recorded media is available for meetings? Is this configurable? : The user can save all recordings as MP4 files. It is not configurable. Which part of a meeting is recorded? : Everything that displays on the screen share and all audio and video from cameras that were seen by users in the meeting are captured as part of the recording. Shared YouTube videos are captured as well. Authenticated meeting attendees who log in with a Sametime client have a group chat for the meeting. The link for the recording is contained in the chat, and the chat persists if the clients keep the chat open. Persistent chats expire after a number of days. For more information, refer to [Updating the time-to-live index for persistent chat](update_ttl_index.md). The meeting moderator has access to the meeting report which contains a full chat transcript, links to files that were shared, as well as a link to the recording if the recorder was started. How long does recorded media remain on servers? Is this configurable? : The default is three days, which is configurable. See Managing recording options for the details. Configuration settings Which settings are configurable server-wide? : Meeting server configuration is all handled on the meeting server; each change is global. Can the administrator restrict a number of participants in a meeting? : Yes, and the default number of participants in a meeting is 100. See Configuring the maximum number of meeting participants for the details. Which settings are configurable though a policy? : The community policy only allows or disallows meetings. There are no other policy-based settings. Can I disable the audio and video options? : No. Can I integrate my telephony system with the Sametime meeting server? : Yes, see Enabling meeting dial-out . Personal or reserved meetings Can a user own or reserve the name of a meeting, that is the meeting URL so that no one can use it? : Yes, the first user who requests the meeting name owns the reserved name. Can I have a persistent meeting? : You can have a reserved meeting name. There is no data preserved or persisting between members entering or leaving. Is a moderated meeting room not available until its owner enters the room? : Yes, the moderated meeting room is not available until the owner enters the room. Migration and existing Sametime environments Can I upgrade from an earlier version of Sametime Meetings? : Yes, see Upgrading from Meetings 11.5 and 11.6 . Can I migrate my Sametime 9.0.1 meeting data to the Sametime meeting server? : No. There is no slide share or file share tool in the new meeting server. There is no data that needs to be migrated. Will my old Sametime meeting URLs work on the new server? : Users can expect the legacy meeting URLs to work. The DNS change from the old host name to the new host name handles the migration to the new server. After the DNS change, users can continue to use the original meeting URLs in calendar entries to join meetings. The new server does not support the legacy meeting client plug-in in the Sametime client, so users must join by URL. Can I use the Sametime 9 meeting plug-in embedded in HCL Notes to connect to a Sametime Meetings server? : The introduction of the External Meeting Provider feature in the Sametime embedded and stand-alone clients deprecate the meeting plug-in in the Notes version 11. Statics, reporting and auditing Are there meeting statistics or reports for Sametime? : Meeting reports can be downloaded. The reports provide information such as: a list of attendees, meeting start and end times, duration, meeting types such as moderated, guests allowed, the time participants were joined and left the meeting, a list of presenters, a link to meeting recording, and the chat transcript. : A Grafana\u00ae dashboard is available with the Sametime install package.

Update, add and delete servers, and manage connection settings (such as host name, port, connection method, authentication method, etc). The file is pushed using a policy, so you can define different settings for different users. This method applies to both the Sametime\u00ae rich client and to the Sametime client embedded in Notes\u00ae. This file is retrieved upon login and will take effect the next time the user restarts the client. managed-settings.xml Web server This file can be used to push client preferences to the users. The file is hosted on a web server and retrieved upon login from the Sametime policy. This method applies to the Sametime rich client and Sametime embedded client in Notes.

Community settings (such as loginAtStartup and host) can be entered here to prepopulate community settings for a first time user. After the user logs in, only the managed-community-configs.xml file can be used to change community settings. Sametime client preferences This section lists the preferences that can be managed for the HCL Sametime Connect Client and Sametime Embedded Client for Notes. Selecting preferences in the client In the Preferences dialog of the HCL Sametime Connect Client and the Notes client, users can choose any Sametime preferences that have not been locked by the administrator. Configuring Sametime client preferences with the Expeditor managed settings framework You can configure and manage the user's Sametime client preferences for capable clients using the Expeditor managed settings framework. The Sametime clients that are Expeditor based include the Sametime client for Windows or Mac, and the HCL Notes embedded Sametime client for Windows or Mac. This excludes the PWA, web and mobile clients. Configuring Sametime preferences using HCL Notes policies To configure preferences for the HCL Sametime Embedded Client for Notes, you can also use the Domino\u00ae Desktop policy settings document . These policies are applied when a Notes user logs into their home mail server and retrieves their desktop policy. These settings will not apply to any other client. Updating connectivity settings with the managed-community-configs.xml file You can distribute updates to HCL Sametime client communities automatically using a managed-community-configs.xml file.

Update, add and delete servers, and manage connection settings (such as host name, port, connection method, authentication method, etc). The file is pushed using a policy, so you can define different settings for different users. This method applies to both the Sametime\u00ae rich client and to the Sametime client embedded in Notes\u00ae. This file is retrieved upon login and will take effect the next time the user restarts the client. managed-settings.xml Web server This file can be used to push client preferences to the users. The file is hosted on a web server and retrieved upon login from the Sametime policy. This method applies to the Sametime rich client and Sametime embedded client in Notes.

Community settings (such as loginAtStartup and host) can be entered here to prepopulate community settings for a first time user. After the user logs in, only the managed-community-configs.xml file can be used to change community settings. Sametime client preferences This section lists the preferences that can be managed for the HCL Sametime Connect Client and Sametime Embedded Client for Notes. Selecting preferences in the client In the Preferences dialog of the HCL Sametime Connect Client and the Notes client, users can choose any Sametime preferences that have not been locked by the administrator. Configuring Sametime client preferences with the Expeditor managed settings framework You can configure and manage the user's Sametime client preferences for capable clients using the Expeditor managed settings framework. The Sametime clients that are Expeditor based include the Sametime client for Windows or Mac, and the HCL Notes embedded Sametime client for Windows or Mac. This excludes the PWA, web and mobile clients. Configuring Sametime preferences using HCL Notes policies To configure preferences for the HCL Sametime Embedded Client for Notes, you can also use the Domino\u00ae Desktop policy settings document . These policies are applied when a Notes user logs into their home mail server and retrieves their desktop policy. These settings will not apply to any other client. Updating connectivity settings with the managed-community-configs.xml file You can distribute updates to HCL Sametime client communities automatically using a managed-community-configs.xml file.

This topic includes the steps to encrypt connections between the clients and the Sametime mux using TLS. To implement the use of TLS, the clients must have the Direct connection using TLS connection option enabled. This setting is under Preferences > Server Communities > Global Connection Settings . There are three methods to set the client connection preferences. Push the setting to users in the managed-community-configs.xml file, which is a good option for clients that are already deployed and in use. Use the plugin_customization.ini file which can be configured and included with the installation package. Manually configure the settings. For additional information, see Updating connectivity settings with the managed-community-configs.xml file . When you enable TLS for the Sametime server connections, TLS version 1.2 is used by default. SSLv3 and TLSv1 have security vulnerabilities and should not be used. To configure the connection between the Sametime server and clients, there are two tasks that must be completed: Configure the encryption settings. Configure the client settings to support a direct connection with TLS. Sametime can be configured to allow legacy encryption along with TLS encryption (both enabled), or strict TLS where only TLS encrypted connections are allowed. The Sametime Mux can listen for both TLS and legacy encrypted connections on the same port number, so there is no need to have a unique port for the TLS encrypted connections, they can also use port 1533. The port number can be changed if desired. For details on configuring the encryption settings, refer to the following topics. Configuring TLS for Sametime mux on Docker and Podman Configuring TLS for Sametime mux on Kubernetes In the HCL Notes client, select File > Preferences > Sametime > Server Communities . The Server Communities window defines the server communities defined for the client. To select this connection method for all server communities, click Server Communities .

Creating a keystore for Sametime mux A keystore consists of a private key and a certificate. Sametime supports both a third-party certificate, signed by a Certification Authority (CA), or a self-signed certificate. Request a certificate and private key from your CA for the hostname used by the Sametime mux. This is the microservice that listens on port 1533 for requests from the Sametime Connect clients (installed clients on desktop). In Kubernetes, the mux is either a Kubernetes service (for example, a load balancer type service) or a Kubernetes ingress service for on-premise Kubernetes. For Docker deployments, the mux listens on port 1533 and does not require any additional service.

This topic includes the steps to encrypt connections between the clients and the Sametime mux using TLS. To implement the use of TLS, the clients must have the Direct connection using TLS connection option enabled. This setting is under Preferences > Server Communities > Global Connection Settings . There are three methods to set the client connection preferences. Push the setting to users in the managed-community-configs.xml file, which is a good option for clients that are already deployed and in use. Use the plugin_customization.ini file which can be configured and included with the installation package. Manually configure the settings. For additional information, see Updating connectivity settings with the managed-community-configs.xml file . When you enable TLS for the Sametime server connections, TLS version 1.2 is used by default. SSLv3 and TLSv1 have security vulnerabilities and should not be used. To configure the connection between the Sametime server and clients, there are two tasks that must be completed: Configure the encryption settings. Configure the client settings to support a direct connection with TLS. Sametime can be configured to allow legacy encryption along with TLS encryption (both enabled), or strict TLS where only TLS encrypted connections are allowed. The Sametime Mux can listen for both TLS and legacy encrypted connections on the same port number, so there is no need to have a unique port for the TLS encrypted connections, they can also use port 1533. The port number can be changed if desired. For details on configuring the encryption settings, refer to the following topics.

This step is optional but is recommended for multi-Kubernetes-cluster deployments . Ensure that the following conditions are met. You have a truststore. In Docker, you can have a single truststore for everything. Alternatively, you can create a truststore for every connection (LDAP, SAML, etc.). In Kubernetes, however, you must create a separate truststore for each connection. For more information, refer to Creating a truststore with a third-party certificate . You have a valid TLS certificate. See Creating a truststore with a third-party certificate for the details. You have a TLS-enabled MongoDB server. For details, refer to the topic Configure mongod and mongos for TLS/SSL in the MongoDB documentation. You can enable TLS on a connection to your MongoDB instance in two ways: Adding a parameter in the connection string Using a method in the MongoClientSettings.Builder class This topic covers the first method. During Sametime Meeting installation, the chatlogging.ini file is created to contain MongoDB server connection information. The connection configuration information within the chatlogging.ini file must be modified to include parameters necessary to establish a secure connection. The Sametime administrator can specify a custom connection URL to the MongoDB server. The CL_MONGO_URL configuration parameter can be set with a MongoDB server URL which includes the required settings for the Sametime server to establish a secure connection to the MongoDB server. After adding the CL_MONGO_URL configuration parameter to the chatlogging.ini file, the default setting is overridden by the settings contained within the URL string. If a self-signed certificate is being used, the certificate must be added to the Sametime certificate store. Open the chatlogging.ini file which is in the HCL Notes data directory. Update or add the CL_MONGO_URL configuration parameter. This parameter is used to override existing configuration settings specified during installation. If changes were made post installation, this parameter exists in the file. If no changes have been made, add the parameter. CL_MONGO_URL=mongodb://user:password@hostname\\_tcpip:port/tls\\_information where: hostname_tcpip : The hostname or TCPIP address of the MongoDB server. port : The port to be used for communication. tls_information : The attributes that identify use of a TLS MongoDB.

This step is optional but is recommended for multi-Kubernetes-cluster deployments . Ensure that the following conditions are met. You have a truststore. In Docker, you can have a single truststore for everything. Alternatively, you can create a truststore for every connection (LDAP, SAML, etc.). In Kubernetes, however, you must create a separate truststore for each connection. For more information, refer to Creating a truststore with a third-party certificate . You have a valid TLS certificate. See Creating a truststore with a third-party certificate for the details. You have a TLS-enabled MongoDB server. For details, refer to the topic Configure mongod and mongos for TLS/SSL in the MongoDB documentation. You can enable TLS on a connection to your MongoDB instance in two ways: Adding a parameter in the connection string Using a method in the MongoClientSettings.Builder class This topic covers the first method. During Sametime Meeting installation, the chatlogging.ini file is created to contain MongoDB server connection information. The connection configuration information within the chatlogging.ini file must be modified to include parameters necessary to establish a secure connection. The Sametime administrator can specify a custom connection URL to the MongoDB server. The CL_MONGO_URL configuration parameter can be set with a MongoDB server URL which includes the required settings for the Sametime server to establish a secure connection to the MongoDB server. After adding the CL_MONGO_URL configuration parameter to the chatlogging.ini file, the default setting is overridden by the settings contained within the URL string. If a self-signed certificate is being used, the certificate must be added to the Sametime certificate store. Open the chatlogging.ini file which is in the HCL Notes data directory. Update or add the CL_MONGO_URL configuration parameter. This parameter is used to override existing configuration settings specified during installation. If changes were made post installation, this parameter exists in the file. If no changes have been made, add the parameter. CL_MONGO_URL=mongodb://user:password@hostname\\_tcpip:port/tls\\_information where: hostname_tcpip : The hostname or TCPIP address of the MongoDB server. port : The port to be used for communication. tls_information : The attributes that identify use of a TLS MongoDB.

STUN is a tool used by other protocols, such as Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) , the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) , and WebRTC . It provides a tool for hosts to discover the presence of a network address translator and to discover the mapped, usually public, Internet Protocol (IP) address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application's User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. The protocol requires assistance from a third-party network server STUN server located on the opposing public side of the NAT, usually the public Internet . For more information, see Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) . Why is STUN needed? Simply put, we use STUN as a tool to help clients determine their public IP address so that they can connect to each other and the Sametime server to send and receive audio and video data. If your deployment of Sametime is all internal and there are no NAT or firewalls between the users and the server, then you might not need to use STUN. If your deployment includes users external to your network, like people working from home, then you likely need a STUN server to help negotiate the audio and video sessions. Default configuration By default, the Sametime server is configured to use the Google Public STUN servers. For Docker, this information is configured in the .env file like this: # STUN servers used to discover the server's public IP. JVB_STUN_SERVERS=stun.l.google.com:19302,stun1.l.google.com:19302,stun2.l.google.com:19302 For Kubernetes, this information is configured in the helm/values.yaml file: jvbStunServers: stun.l.google.com:19302,stun1.l.google.com:19302,stun2.l.google.com:19302 In both cases, this configuration is telling the server to use these STUN servers: stun.l.google.com stun1.l.google.com stun2.l.google.com Using UDP port 19302. It is important to note that if the server or clients is unable to reach the configured STUN servers, n-way meetings does not work properly. When planning your deployment, make sure that the STUN servers are available over the network. Optional configurations If you already have a STUN server in your environment or wish to use an alternative public STUN server, simply update the appropriate settings above before you deploy the server. It can be modified post-deployment as well. For more information on this, see Configuring alternate STUN servers . If your deployment does not require the use of STUN, then you can disable this by simply commenting out the appropriate line in either the .env or values.yaml file and installing the server.

Log into the community pod. Find the name of the community pod using the kubectl get pods command. The results shows the pod names which contains hashes. Run the following command to log into the community pod. Include the pod name. kubectl exec -it pod\\_name --container=community -\u2013 bash Confirm that the community pod is receiving the trust store. Look for the ldaptruststore.p12 file in /local/notesdata directory. If the file is present, continue to the next step. If the file is missing, the LDAP secret is not being read properly. Confirm that LDAP secret has been created in the correct namespace if using namespaces. Open the values.yaml file and confirm that the LDAP secret name is specified correctly in the ldapConfigSecret: \"ldap-config-secret\" format. Confirm that the sametime.ini and UserInfoConfig.xml files are updated. Open the /local/notesdata/sametime.ini file in the community pod. and confirm the LDAP TLS settings are present. Locate the following statements in the file: STLDAP_TLS_TRUST_STORE_TYPE=p12 STLDAP_TLS_TRUST_STORE_FILE = /local/notesdata/ldaptruststore.p12 The file name and path are hard coded and should not changed. STLDAP_TLS_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD= thepassword This should be your actual password for the trust store. If these are missing, confirm the values.yaml settings are present as mentioned in the confirm you have the correct configuration details step. Open the /local/notesdata/UserInfoConfig.xml and confirm that you see the correct details in the <Storage Details> section for the host name and port of the LDAP server. Confirm that the below line is present, where \u201cthepassword\u201d is your trust store password: <SslProperties KeyStorePath=\"/local/notesdata/ldaptruststore.p12\" KeyStorePassword=\"password\" /> If anything in this section is missing, examine the settings in the values.yaml file for accuracy as decribed in the next step. Confirm you have correct configuration details . Confirm your other values in the values.yaml pertaining to LDAP: ldapHost: ldapHost: server\\_host\\_name ldapPort: \"636\" ldapTls: true Where server_host_name should be the LDAP server host name or IP address. Check the bind credentials in the sametime-global-secrets, they are base64 encoded. First, issue the command: kubectl edit secret sametime-global-secrets Locate the lines beginning with LdapBindEntryDn and LdapBindEntryPassword . Take the value of each setting and base64 decode them, they should be your Bind DN and the Bind password. If these are wrong, then base64 encode them. To decode the values, issue the following command: echo -n \u2018value\u2019 | base64 -d Where \u2018value\u2019 is the encoded value in the secret. If you need to change the credentials, you can set it to the base64 encoded value of the correct Bind name and password, directly in the secret, but it should also be set in the template file as well. If you fail to update the template file, then your existing secrets are overridden when you run a helm upgrade command. The template file is located where the helm directory was saved, and it is found under /helm/templates/sametime-secrets.yaml To change the Bind credentials, see Changing the LDAP service account password in Kubernetes . For more information on secrets, see the Managing secrets in Kubernetes and Modifying secrets topics. If you are overriding the default configuration using an extra-community-config secret, there are additional steps to take to correct the Bind DN. See Changing the LDAP service account password in Kubernetes . Confirm TLS is negotiating properly between Sametime and LDAP In Sametime 12 only TLS 1.2 is enabled by default. If the LDAP server you are connecting to doesnn't support TLS 1.2, then you need to override the default configuration. Sametime connects to LDAP attempting to negotiate TLS with the following ciphers: RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0x009D) RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0x002F) Support for at least one of the ciphers might need to be added to your LDAP server, such is the case for HCL Domino 12.0.2, for details see Sametime 12.0 TLS required ciphers to connect to Domino 12.0.2 LDAP There is a known issue when using a newer version of keytool to create the trust store, Sametime is unable to read it. To work around the problem, recreate the trust store with keytool and add the argument: -J-Dkeystore.pkcs12.legacy to the command. For more details, see the Sametime unable to read trust store causing LDAP connection to fail article. To determine if your TLS is not negotiating and finding a common cipher suite enable debug. Start with VP_LDAP_TRACE=1 and ST_TLS_DEBUG=1. See the Enabling Community debug in Kubernetes topic. By default, the community pod connects to LDAP on the pod IP address range, and the firewall should be configured to permit this traffic. If you are unable to open up the entire pod IP range to LDAP, consider implementing a network address translation, or IP Masquerade solution, which will give the traffic from the pods an IP in a range of your choosing. An example of this is the Google Kubernetes Engine IP masquerade agent solution. For more information, see the IP masquerade agent Google Cloud topic. Each cloud provider has an unique solution, see your vendor\u2019s documentation for more details. The community pod must resolve the host name of the LDAP server, or you can configure the IP address instead. If the host name of the LDAP server does not resolve in DNS, you can configure Host Aliases for the Community pod. See the Configuring host aliases for Kubernetes deployments article for steps. Netstat is installed on the community pod and can be helpful to understanding if the connectivity is succeeding or not succeeding. To use netstat on the community pod enter the command: netstat -an | grep 636 Substitute your secure LDAP port number if you are not using port 636. You might find that the default settings for LDAP are incompatible with your LDAP implementation and are causing problems Sametime 12 connects with multiple connections, the login, resolve and search connections uses the same settings. These settings are configured in the StCommunityConfig.xml, which are pulled from the values.yaml file and sametime-global-secrets. These can be overwritten by the extra-community-configs secret. The UserInfo task (business cards) uses different settings. These settings are in theUserInfoConfig.xml file and are also pulled from the values.yaml file and can be overwritten by the extra-community-configs secret. It is also possible to create a custom java class file to transform the LDAP searches for more efficient requests to LDAP. See Configuring the class file on Kubernetes for more details.

Open the values.yaml file and confirm that the LDAP secret name is specified correctly in the ldapConfigSecret: \"ldap-config-secret\" format. Confirm that the sametime.ini and UserInfoConfig.xml files are updated. Open the /local/notesdata/sametime.ini file in the community pod. and confirm the LDAP TLS settings are present. Locate the following statements in the file: STLDAP_TLS_TRUST_STORE_TYPE=p12 STLDAP_TLS_TRUST_STORE_FILE = /local/notesdata/ldaptruststore.p12 The file name and path are hard coded and should not changed. STLDAP_TLS_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD= thepassword This should be your actual password for the trust store. If these are missing, confirm the values.yaml settings are present as mentioned in the confirm you have the correct configuration details step. Open the /local/notesdata/UserInfoConfig.xml and confirm that you see the correct details in the <Storage Details> section for the host name and port of the LDAP server. Confirm that the below line is present, where \u201cthepassword\u201d is your trust store password: <SslProperties KeyStorePath=\"/local/notesdata/ldaptruststore.p12\" KeyStorePassword=\"password\" /> If anything in this section is missing, examine the settings in the values.yaml file for accuracy as decribed in the next step. Confirm you have correct configuration details . Confirm your other values in the values.yaml pertaining to LDAP: ldapHost: ldapHost: server\\_host\\_name ldapPort: \"636\" ldapTls: true Where server_host_name should be the LDAP server host name or IP address. Check the bind credentials in the sametime-global-secrets, they are base64 encoded. First, issue the command: kubectl edit secret sametime-global-secrets Locate the lines beginning with LdapBindEntryDn and LdapBindEntryPassword . Take the value of each setting and base64 decode them, they should be your Bind DN and the Bind password. If these are wrong, then base64 encode them. To decode the values, issue the following command: echo -n \u2018value\u2019 | base64 -d Where \u2018value\u2019 is the encoded value in the secret. If you need to change the credentials, you can set it to the base64 encoded value of the correct Bind name and password, directly in the secret, but it should also be set in the template file as well. If you fail to update the template file, then your existing secrets are overridden when you run a helm upgrade command. The template file is located where the helm directory was saved, and it is found under /helm/templates/sametime-secrets.yaml To change the Bind credentials, see Changing the LDAP service account password in Kubernetes . For more information on secrets, see the Managing secrets in Kubernetes and Modifying secrets topics. If you are overriding the default configuration using an extra-community-config secret, there are additional steps to take to correct the Bind DN. See Changing the LDAP service account password in Kubernetes . Confirm TLS is negotiating properly between Sametime and LDAP In Sametime 12 only TLS 1.2 is enabled by default. If the LDAP server you are connecting to doesnn't support TLS 1.2, then you need to override the default configuration. Sametime connects to LDAP attempting to negotiate TLS with the following ciphers: RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0x009D) RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0x002F) Support for at least one of the ciphers might need to be added to your LDAP server, such is the case for HCL Domino 12.0.2, for details see Sametime 12.0 TLS required ciphers to connect to Domino 12.0.2 LDAP There is a known issue when using a newer version of keytool to create the trust store, Sametime is unable to read it. To work around the problem, recreate the trust store with keytool and add the argument: -J-Dkeystore.pkcs12.legacy to the command. For more details, see the Sametime unable to read trust store causing LDAP connection to fail article. To determine if your TLS is not negotiating and finding a common cipher suite enable debug. Start with VP_LDAP_TRACE=1 and ST_TLS_DEBUG=1. See the Enabling Community debug in Kubernetes topic. By default, the community pod connects to LDAP on the pod IP address range, and the firewall should be configured to permit this traffic. If you are unable to open up the entire pod IP range to LDAP, consider implementing a network address translation, or IP Masquerade solution, which will give the traffic from the pods an IP in a range of your choosing. An example of this is the Google Kubernetes Engine IP masquerade agent solution. For more information, see the IP masquerade agent Google Cloud topic. Each cloud provider has an unique solution, see your vendor\u2019s documentation for more details. The community pod must resolve the host name of the LDAP server, or you can configure the IP address instead. If the host name of the LDAP server does not resolve in DNS, you can configure Host Aliases for the Community pod. See the Configuring host aliases for Kubernetes deployments article for steps. Netstat is installed on the community pod and can be helpful to understanding if the connectivity is succeeding or not succeeding. To use netstat on the community pod enter the command: netstat -an | grep 636 Substitute your secure LDAP port number if you are not using port 636. You might find that the default settings for LDAP are incompatible with your LDAP implementation and are causing problems Sametime 12 connects with multiple connections, the login, resolve and search connections uses the same settings. These settings are configured in the StCommunityConfig.xml, which are pulled from the values.yaml file and sametime-global-secrets. These can be overwritten by the extra-community-configs secret. The UserInfo task (business cards) uses different settings. These settings are in theUserInfoConfig.xml file and are also pulled from the values.yaml file and can be overwritten by the extra-community-configs secret. It is also possible to create a custom java class file to transform the LDAP searches for more efficient requests to LDAP. See Configuring the class file on Kubernetes for more details.

If you are unfamiliar with these technologies, refer to Platforms . To learn more about Kubernetes, see An Overview of Kubernetes . Media audio and video streams over UDP port 10,000 for Docker or UDP 30,000 for Kubernetes. Sametime requires a STUN server if any user is attending from behind a firewall. The default configuration comes with the public Google STUN server configured using UDP Port 19302 configured; however, any STUN server can be used. Both clients and the Sametime services need connectivity to the STUN service. For more information, see Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) . The following examples show several scenarios on how to deploy Sametime to include external users. Small Sametime Premium deployment on Docker If your environment includes a DMZ, you can place Sametime in the DMZ and open the required ports. In this example, clients can connect to Sametime from both inside the internal network as well as from the Internet. Browser clients and Mobile clients connect to Sametime using HTTPS port 443, and UDP port 10,000. These clients also connect directly to STUN on the Internet (or internally if installed as an optional configuration) on port 19302 UDP. Mobile clients must connect to the push notification services on the Internet in order to receive chat notifications in the client. Sametime desktop clients (those that are installed rich clients\u2014Sametime Connect and Sametime embedded) are connecting on port 1533 TCP. The following graphic shows a small HCL Sametime Premium with internet access using Docker. Larger Sametime Premium deployments If you have a medium- or large-size user base, you can deploy Sametime with Kubernetes. Kubernetes can be installed as an on-premise configuration or by leveraging a third party Kubernetes service such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Amazon\u2019s Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), among others. When you deploy Sametime in Kubernetes, the Kubernetes cluster requires three node pools. Each node pool performs a different function. One node pool is dedicated to video, a second one for recorders, and a main node pool for all other Sametime pods. The number of nodes in each node pool determines the capacity of the environment. An ingress controller is used to handle front-end connections from users to the web chat and meeting https services. Media streams are over UDP port 30,000 and connect directly to the video node pool. Sametime desktop clients connect to a Sametime Mux Kubernetes service (svc) on port 1533 (TCP). The following graphic shows Kubernetes node pools and ingress. Connectivity for end users is very similar to the Docker deployment. The difference is UDP port 30,000 is used for media streams instead of port 10,000. There may be multiple nodes in the video node pool, and clients must be able to reach each one on port 30,000.
