# Creating a policy {#adminui_policy_create_new .task}

You can create a custom policy that takes precedents over the Default and Anonymous policies. There can be many custom policies based on the requirements for your environment.

Newly created policies are assigned a weight higher than the current hightest weight value. The new policy is not in effect until the server is refreshed. After creating the new policy you can restart the sever or wait for the next refresh which happens every hour based on when the server was started.

1.  Click the **Add a policy** for the policy to copy.

2.  Enter a name for the policy in the **Policy Name** field.

    Policy names must be unique.

3.  Select the features to associate with the policy. When finished, click **Add**.

    The new policy is added to the table.
