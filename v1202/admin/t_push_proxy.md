# Push messaging through a proxy {#t_push_proxy .concept}

Depending on your network settings, your firewalls could prevent Sametime proxy from connecting to push networks like Apple Push Notification Service \(APNS\) and Firebase Cloud Messaging \(FCM\) through the Internet. Sametime supports the sending of APNS and FCM messages through a proxy server. If you need to send APNS or FCM message through a proxy server in your environment, you need to configure the settings for the messages you want routed through the proxy.
