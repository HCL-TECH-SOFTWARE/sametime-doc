# Assigning users and groups to policies {#adminui_policy_assign .task}

Policies are not used until assigned to users or groups.

1.  Click the **Assign** icon \(![assign policy icon](Images/icon_assign_policy.png)\) for the policy being assigned, type or search for the user or group name to assign the policy.

2.  Select the name from the search results. The name is added to the **Assign to** list below the search field.

    You can continue to search for names to assign the policy to. To remove a name, click the **Delete** icon next to the name.

3.  When finished, clicked **Save**.

    **Note:** For the policy to take immediate effect, restart the server. Otherwise, policy refresh happens every hour based on when the sever was started.
