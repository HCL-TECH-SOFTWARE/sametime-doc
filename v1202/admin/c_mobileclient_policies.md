# Mobile client policies {#c_mobileclient_policies .concept}

While many user policies are available in the Sametime ecosystem, only a subset of these policies apply to the mobile clients. This section describes the policies and configurations available to the said clients.

General policies apply to all clients. This section describes the unique response of the mobile client to these policies.
-   **[File transfer policies](c_file_transfer.md)**  
Sametime allows users to download files through links in the chat. Mobile support has also been added for this new functionality.
-   **[Security policies](c_security_policies.md)**  
Every internet service that you use or provide poses risks to your system and the network to which it is connected. Your security policy defines what you protect. This section describes the security policies and configurations available to you.
