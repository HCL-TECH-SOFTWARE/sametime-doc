# Exporting and saving contacts on your mobile device {#c_save_contacts .concept}

As an administrator, you can control how your contact list is managed. Edit the following policy to fit your business needs.

## Policy id = im.mobile.allowContactExport, Default Setting: ON {#section_rrk_stw_3tb .section}

By default, Sametime for Android users can export their contacts to their local contact database. Turn this setting off to disable the export feature.

**Note:** This policy does not apply to Sametime for iOS. Due to security and compliance reasons, Sametime for iOS users can only save a contact's phone number or email address, and not the entire contact.
