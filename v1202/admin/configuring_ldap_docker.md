# Configuring LDAP on Docker and Podman {#configuring_ldap_docker .task}



The Docker and Podman commands are similar. The only difference is that docker precedes the command when issued in a Docker environment and podman precedes the name in a Podman environment. Example commands used in the Sametime documentation are shown using Docker. For Podman, change docker to podman.
