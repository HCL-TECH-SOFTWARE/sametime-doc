# Copying a policy {#adminui_policy_add_copy .task}

You can create new policies by copying and editing a current policy.

The new policy is not in effect until the server is refreshed. After creating the new policy you can restart the sever or wait for the next refresh which happens every hour based on when the server was started.

1.  Click the **Copy icon**\(![](Images/icon_copy_policy.png)\) next to the policy to copy.

2.  Type a name for the new policy and click **Save Copy**.

    The new policy is added to the table and assigned a weight higher than the current highest weight value.

3.  Edit the new policy by clicking the **Edit icon**.

    When finished with changes, click **Save Policy**.
