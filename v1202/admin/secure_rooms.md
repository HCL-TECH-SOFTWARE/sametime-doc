# Disabling secure meeting room names {#secure_rooms .task}

Users are provisioned with a personal meeting room the first time that they log into their meeting. Their personal meeting room is created with a secure name that cannot be easily guessed by other users. For example: be:MeetMe.CWGRAff90q9HETLne4mhzA.

Meeting rooms with a user-friendly name or naming conventions might be preferred, for example: MeetMe.username~40company.com. If this is the case, the secure naming feature can be disabled.

Disabling secure meeting room name feature does not affect existing meeting rooms. Changing the setting affects only the meeting rooms provisioned after changing the setting.
