# Enabling self-signed certificates {#c_mobile_self_certificates .concept}

By default, Sametime does not allow the use of self-signed certificates for mobile connections to the Sametime server. Due to security and compliance issues, users must first acknowledge the risks before being able to make any changes to this policy. Edit the following policy to fit your business needs.

## Policy id = im.mobile.disableUntrustedSsl, Default Setting: ON {#section_end_lgg_htb .section}

Turn this setting off to enable the use of self-signed certificates. This rule also applies to pre-production environments that use self-signed certificates.
