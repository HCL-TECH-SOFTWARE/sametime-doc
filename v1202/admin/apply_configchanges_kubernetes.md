# Applying configuration changes in Kubernetes or Openshift {#apply_confichanges_kubernetes .task}

Configuration files contain environment variables that can be changed and applied to the Sametime server.

You can make configuration changes to the Sametime deployment server by modifying the helm/values.yaml file.

**Note:** These settings are case sensitive and must be entered as shown.

1.  Edit the helm charts and make modifications.

2.  Go to the helm directory.

3.  Apply your changes to the environment.

    Verify that you are in the helm directory and run the following command to apply changes. Specify the Sametime deployment name for your environment. The default for Sametime Premium version 12 is sametime.

    ``` {#codeblock_iyn_51d_d5b}
    helm upgrade sametime\_deployment\_name .
    ```

    **Note:** Be sure to include the dot at the end. It is part of the command.

    If you are unsure of your deployment name, issue the helm list command to find the name. If you upgraded from an earlier Sametime release, the default name is sametime-meetings.

4.  Restart the pods with the changes. Use the kubectl scale command to scale the pods to zero and then to one that have been changed. You must run the commands for each pod that the change affects.

    1.  Run the following command to scale the pod to zero.

        Scale the pod to zero, where pod\_deployment\_name is the pod name.

        ``` {#codeblock_cwz_mwc_d5b}
        
        kubectl scale deploy pod\_deployment\_name --replicas=0
        
        ```

    2.  Run the following command to scale the pod to one.

        ``` {#codeblock_i2c_4wc_d5b}
        
        kubectl scale deploy pod\_deployment\_name --replicas=1
        ```
