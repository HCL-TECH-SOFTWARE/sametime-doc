# Sametime clients {#hcl_sametime_clients .concept}

Several client types are supported providing flexibility in how users can access chats and meetings. A single deployment can implement several client types.

The following Sametime client types are supported:

## Connect client
The Connect client is a stand-alone client that allows for connection to the Sametime server for meetings and chat. It is installed on the user's desktop and requires administrative privileges to perform the install. It can be installed on a Windows or MacOS platform. This client provides access to chat features. Documentation for this client is provided as Help within the client.

## Embedded client
An Embedded client provides connection to the Sametime server within another product. HCL Verse, HCL iNotes, HCL Connections, and HCL Digital contained an embedded Sametime client. Because it is part of the product, starting and using Sametime is done within the product where it is embedded. This client provides access to chat features. Documentation for this client is provided as Help within the client.

## Mobile client
Mobile clients provide access to a Sametime server using an iOS and Android mobile device. A HCL Sametime app must be installed on the mobile device to connect to the server. This client provides access to chat and meeting features.
