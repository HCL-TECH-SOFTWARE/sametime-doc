# Integrating with HCL Connections {#ltpa_configure_connections .task}

You can integrate Sametime to enable chat services in HCL Connections.

Sametime and Connections must share a common directory.

If you are enabling the HCL Connections Profiles Photo URLs in your Sametime business card configuration, single sign on \(SSO\) might be required for Sametime to access the URLs.
