# Migrating and Upgrading {#migrating .task}

This section provides information on migrating data from an earlier release to Sametime 12.

-   **[Planning for migration to Sametime 12](c_migration_planning.md)**  
Sametime 12 requires a new product install and migration of data from your previous version. Do not uninstall the previous version until the V12 installation is finalized and working as expected.
-   **[Upgrading to a new version or applying a fixpack](upgrade_install_fixpack.md)**  
Newer versions and fix packs contain new features and fixes. You do not need to remove your current Sametime 12 installation when upgrading to a new version.
