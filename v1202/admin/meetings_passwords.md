# Defining Meetings password requirements {#meetings_passwords .task}

The default requirement for a meeting is that the password must be at least eight characters. To increase the password requirements, additional rules can be specified.

A meeting owner can define a meeting password when creating a meeting. When a meeting participant logs into the meeting and the password rules are displayed as the password is typed. As a requirement is met, a green circle with a check mark is displayed next to the requirement.
