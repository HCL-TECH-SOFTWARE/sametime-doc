# Statement of support {#c_troubleshooting_supportstatement .concept}

HCL Sametime relies on a range of commercial and non-commercial third-party software. This statement of support describes the support that customers can expect for various configurations of HCL Sametime, other HCL products and third-party software.

Sametime is tested with a prescribed list of HCL products and third-party software during the development of new releases. Because of environment uniqueness and customizations, all possible configurations are not tested. Software dependencies are tested by using specified versions, and those versions are listed with the system requirements.

-   If the versions are updated without features changes, they are considered supported.
-   If version updates introduce changes that impact Sametime or are removed from that dependency's support, they are no longer fully supported and considered "best effort" support. HCL supports these environments until the dependency is determined to be the cause of the problem.

HCL provides support for configuration and problem determination of third-party software that is supplied with HCL software. Inâ€¯all other cases, users must obtain configuration assistance and support for third-party software. If it is determined that a problem reported to HCL is caused by third-party software, users must engage directly with the service provider for support or assistance.

The statements in this document are also presented in the [HCL Support Guide](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010420). Nothing in this document shall be construed as supplementing, modifying or superseding the terms of your HCL Master License Agreement, or other applicable agreement, for HCL Sametime, nor shall it create any obligation for HCL to deliver a level of support other than that provided under relevant HCL agreements.

## Categories of support {#section_spn_jds_3xb .section}

For support purposes, we define three categories of configuration:

Supported Configuration
:   A supported configuration is a combination of HCL and other third-party software that has been validated by HCL. HCL provides full support for HCL software configured within this category. Support is provided under the terms of the [HCL Support Guide](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010420) to ensure that the software operates within its specifications.

Unsupported configurations
:   An unsupported configuration is a combination of HCL and third-party software that is known to not work with the HCL Sametime platform is not supported.

:   HCL does not provide support for unsupported configurations. Resolutions to problems or incompatibilities that are found in unsupported configurations are not generally available.

:   Customers can seek assistance the following types assistance for a fee.

    -   HCL services
    -   Authorized HCL Business Partners
    -   Another service provider provided such services fall within the terms and conditions of your HCL agreement

Other Configurations
:   Some configurations of HCL software and other software that are not listed as supported or unsupported configurations but are expected to perform within the accepted bounds of reliability, function, and performance.

:   Configurations that fall into this category typically substitute HCL or third-party software for similar software. An example is a newer fix level of the HCL or third-party software. Another configuration can consist of a third-party software product that adheres to supported specifications, such as a new MongoDB fix pack or LDAP server that adheres to standard or external security manager that integrates public APIs.
