# Copying and pasting of chat content to external applications {#c_restrict_copy_paste .concept}

Depending on your organization's security policy, you can restrict users from copying chat content to the clipboard and sharing outside of the application. Edit the following policy to fit your business needs.

## Policy id = im.mobile.restrictClipboard, Default Setting: ON {#section_g5h_qym_htb .section}

By default, Sametime restricts users from copying chat content to the clipboard and then sharing outside of the application. Meetings URLs and recording links are not affected by this policy. Users are always allowed to copy and paste chat content within Sametime. Turn this setting off to allow users to share chat content outside the application.
