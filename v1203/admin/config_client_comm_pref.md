|Attribute|Variable type|Description|
|---------|-------------|-----------|
|altCommunityConfig.managedIds|String|Required. A comma-delimited set of IDs that represents each alternate community. For example, altCommunityConfig.managedIDs=altHost1,altHost2 defines two alternate communities named altHost1 and altHost 2.|
|altCommunityConfig.altHost.altHostID.targetCommunityHost|String|Required. The host name of the alternate community. altHostID represents the ID you defined for the alternate community in the managedIds preference, such as altHost1.|

|altCommunityConfig.altHost.altHostID.weight|Integer. Default is 0.|The weight of the alternate community configuration relative to other alternate communities. The higher the value, the greater the weight. For example, a connection to an alternate community with a weight of 2 is tried before one with a weight of 0. Regardless of the assigned weight, the client attempts a connection to the last successful alternate community first.|
|altCommunityConfig.altHost.altHostID.type|String. The default is postDefaultConfig.|Determines if the alternate community connection is tried before the default community or after. A value of postDefaultConfig attempts the connection after trying to connect to the default community. A value of preDefaultConfig attempts to connect to the alternate community first.|
