# Enabling conference dial-in {#meetings_dialin .task}

You can set up your environment to allow users to dial in to a meeting using a SIP-capable phone system that is connected to a public switched telephone network \(PSTN\). This feature uses the ilink TeamCall Meeting Gateway \(TMG\).

To enable meeting dial-in, the following must be installed in your Sametime server:

-   Sametime 11.6 or later versions
-   Debian 11 Linux host system or VMware to run TMG service \(on-premises or in private cloud\)
    -   CPU, RAM of TMG host: 25% each of the capacity of the Sametime server host

To enable your Sametime environment for dial-in, you must contact an ilink sales representative at [sales@ilink.de](mailto:sales@ilink.de). The ilink professional service team performs a remote installation. After the TMG is installed, it runs in the background and no administrator support is required.

The TeamCall Meeting Gateway for HCL Sametime Premium provides audio waiting rooms for moderated meetings.

If the user experiences dial-in or telephony problems, they must contact ilink support at [sales@ilink.de](mailto:sales@ilink.de) to open a ticket for assistance.
